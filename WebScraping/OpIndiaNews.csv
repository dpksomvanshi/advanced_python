0,"14 October, 2023 ","“Today I realise how lucky we are as Indians”, Shehla Rashid credits PM Modi for peace and safety in Kashmir after prosecution sanction granted against her"," Though Shehla Rashid has turned off replies to these tweets, many people have lauded her for speaking the truth about the changed reality of Kashmir particularly after the abrogation of Article 370. On 14th October (Saturday), JNU alumna and Kashmir-based ‘activist’ Shehla Rashid took to X to heap praise on PM Modi, the administration in Jammu and Kashmir along with the Indian Army in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. Reacting to the fast-paced developments in the Middle East, she asserted that these developments have made her realise how lucky we are as Indians.  In her post, she wrote, “Looking at the events in the Middle East, today I realise how lucky we are as Indians. The Indian Army and security forces have sacrificed their everything for our safety. Credit where it’s due.”Looking at the events in the Middle East, today I realise how lucky we are as Indians. The Indian Army and security forces have sacrificed their everything for our safety.Credit where it's due @pmoindia @HMOIndia @manojsinha_ @adgpi @ChinarcorpsIA for bringing peace to Kashmir https://t.co/qeUCkJq9g3She also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Manoj Sinha, the Indian Army, and the Chinar Corps of the Indian Army for bringing peace to Jammu and Kashmir.Former JNU alumna Shehla Rashid also noted that peace can’t be ensured without security and the ongoing crisis in the Middle East stamps it further. She added that the Chinar Corps of the Indian Army, along with the brave soldiers of the CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir Police, have made tremendous sacrifices to ensure long-term peace and security in Kashmir.Peace is impossible without security, as the Middle East crisis has shown. The Indian Army @ChinarcorpsIA along with @crpfindia and brave personnel of Jammu Kashmir Police @JmuKmrPolice have made tremendous sacrifices to ensure long-term peace and security in Kashmir 🙏Though Shehla Rashid has turned off replies to these tweets, many people have lauded her for speaking the truth about the changed reality of Kashmir particularly after the abrogation of Article 370. However, in the past, she had an illustrious career in peddling fake news and spreading anti-India rhetoric in Kashmir. Notably, she has previously served as the former vice-president of the JNU student union and did politics on behalf of AISA, the student organisation of left parties. Back then, she made regular statements against BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even resorted to fake news peddling on many instances to show a false narrative of Muslims being victimised in Jammu and Kashmir by the ‘oppressive’ Indian Armed forces.   In one instance, she even went to peddle fake news to implicate the Indian army in a bad light and toed the line of Pakistani propaganda against the security forces which was exposed by the Indian Army. In a series of tweets, Rashid alleged that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is grim and that the armed forces are using excessive force on the Kashmiris. It is notable that Shehla Rashid’s change of heart in the matter comes just days after the Delhi LG granted sanction for a case against her over her comments spreading fake news. Supreme Court lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava had filed a criminal complaint against Shehla Rashid for her comments, seeking her arrest for allegedly spreading fake news against the Indian Army and the government. The complaint stated that she had prima facie committed an offence of sedition under Section 124-A of IPC. It added that Rashid has further committed offences of ‘promoting enmity between the classes’ under Sections 153, 153-A, 504, and 505 of IPC.In connection to her baseless tweets against the Indian army, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, VK Saxena on 10th January, this year granted prosecution sanction against Shehla Rashid. It allowed the prosecution to charge her under section 196 of CrPC, 1973, for her tweets against the Indian Army. For the last few days, the Former JNUSU Vice President Shehla Rashid has spent time in Kashmir, and post the prosecution sanction against her in connection to the fake news against the Indian Army, she has been retracting some of her earlier stances. For example, she had once approached the Supreme Court against the decision to abrogate Article 370. However, she recently withdrew her petition over this issue. Similarly, earlier this year, on the occasion of Independence Day, she responded positively to the news of Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist Javed’s brother Raees Mattoo hoisting the Indian national flag. Reflecting on that, she had also asserted that the situation has improved in the state followed by recent tweets where she has underscored the changed reality of Kashmir and praised PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for peace and safety in Kashmir.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Amidst the ongoing war between the State of Israel and Hamas, a ‘student group’ in Jamia Millia Islamia extended its support to the Palestine-based terror outfit. On Friday (13th October), students of the central varsity were seen wearing badges and headbands, with the words ‘with Hamas’ inscribed on them. At the same time, they were heard raising slogans of ‘Intifada Inquilab.’ The Hamas supporters were part of the Students Islamic Organisation (SIO) of India, which is the student wing of the radical Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. The development was confirmed on X (formerly Twitter) by Swarajya journalist Swati Goel Sharma. Leftist and Islamist ‘student groups’ AISA and SIO in Jamia Milia Islamia had responded to the call for ‘global jihad’ by Hamas. Shocking.

Most of the victims are civilians, as Hamas terrorists opened fire on civilian areas in Israel near the Gaza border.Hamas also abducted a large number of victims, holding them as hostages in Gaza. Bodies of over 1500 Hamas terrorists have been located in Israel and along the border, killed in retaliatory fire by Israeli forces.Hundreds of Hamas terrorists entered Israel through land, sea and even using paragliders, after overwhelming the Iron Dome missile defence system of Israel by firing over 5000 rockets in just 20 minutes.Israel has launched a massive attack on Gaza Strip following the terror attack, and has struck hundreds of Hamas sites. Israel has also cut power and water supply to Gaza and has prevented entry of supplies to the landlocked coastal strip.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

2,"13 October, 2023 ","Ladakh Congress working president justifies Hamas atrocities on innocent Israelis, tries to falsely project ‘Palestinian Mujahideens’ as victims"," Umpteen visuals are available on the internet that depict the extent of brutality and savagery that Hamas has inflicted on Israeli civilians.Along the lines of his higher-ups in Delhi, Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of Ladakh Congress has declared his unwavering support for the Palestinians and their terrorist organisation Hamas, which has been committing horrific atrocities and war crimes against Israel since it launched an unprecedented attack on the nation on October 7. ‘Hamas Mujahideen from Gaza have started to take back their land from America’s pet Israel, killed and kidnapped Israeli soldiers. They have shown Israel ke wajood ki koi haisiyat nahi hai’: Congress Working President, Ladakh pic.twitter.com/9oBM9Dr4YgThe Islamist terrorist organisation Hamas has been inflicting unspeakable violent crimes on Israeli civilians, including brutal murders, the beheading of children, rape, kidnap and taking hostage, yet the Congress leader, in a video shared by Times Now, is heard hailing the Hamas terrorists and justifying the atrocities they have been committing.He can be heard applauding the ‘Hamas Mujahideen’ from Gaza for carrying out attacks against Israel, which he refers to as the slave of the ‘biggest devils’- the United States of America. The Congress leader further lauded the Palestinians for conquering back their land which he claimed they lost to the Israelis.The Congress leader proudly admitted that Hamas terrorists have killed and kidnapped several Israeli soldiers while justifying the atrocities that Hamas perpetrated against Israel and its defence forces as well as its innocent citizens. He exulted that the Palestinian mujahideen had shown to the world that they would never submit to the Israelis despite all the constraints, sanctions, and repression.Further gushing over the war Hamas has declared against Israel, he said that the Palestinians have proven that “Israel ke wajood ki koi haisiyat nahi hai. Woh makde ke jaale see bhi kamjor hai, yeh unhone 7 October ko dikhla diya” (the existence of Israel is worthless. It is weaker than a spider’s web. This the Palestinians proved on October 7), he said.Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of the Ladakh Congress, continued to blatantly lie projecting Israelis as the aggressors and the Palestinians as the victims despite the fact that Israel only launched counterattacks on Gaza as retaliation to the devastation and mass destruction Hamas terrorists caused in Israel. He claimed that the Israeli soldiers killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians and massacred their babies. Though it is true that many civilians from both sides have fallen prey to the war that was started by the Hamas terrorists on October 7, there are umpteen videos and images available on the internet that depict the extent of brutality and savagery members of the Islamists terror organisation Hamas have inflicted on Israeli civilians and defence personnel in these last 5 days. The numerous distressing visuals that have surfaced on social media, in fact, serve as evidence that Hamas terrorists have murdered over 1300 innocent Israeli people, including women, the elderly, and newborns, by shooting, stabbing, beheading, and even burning them alive. In fact, on Thursday, October 12, the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel took the extraordinary step of releasing gruesome photos of murdered babies to reporters and the public, seeking to underscore the atrocities carried out by Hamas in its savage rampage through southern Israel on Saturday. OpIndia also listed 15 such videos showing how Hamas targeted innocent civilians and inflicted brutalities in Israel.The views of Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of Ladakh Congress, were in tandem with his party supremos who had also expressed sympathy for Palestinians. A resolution passed on October 9, by the Congress Working Committee (CWC) voiced concern over the situation and urged for a ceasefire. The resolution however backed the Palestinian people’s rights.The Congress party’s official statement emphasised the process of “dialogue and negotiations” to resolve the problem between Israel and Palestine.India's Congress party comes in support of Palestine after a key meeting https://t.co/5XqyfamvVH“The Indian National Congress has always believed that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of self-respect, equality, and dignity must be fulfilled only through a process of dialogue and negotiations while ensuring the legitimate national security interests of the Israeli people.

3,"13 October, 2023 ",Politics of prisoners heats up in Tamil Nadu: Muslim groups demand the release of 36 Muslim prisoners after AIADMK sought the release of Coimbatore blast convicts," CM Stalin questioned AIADMK for their sudden demand for the release of Muslim prisoners, while BJP has opposed the demandPolitics have heated up in Tamil Nadu over the demand to release Muslim prisoners from jail, including those convicted in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast. Opposition parties including AIADMK, which recently exited NDA, are demanding the release of Muslim prisoners who have served a long time in jail. BJP is opposing the demand, while DMK is questioning AIADMK’s sudden love for Muslim prisoners. DMK is also trying to take a secular stand here, saying there the govt will not see prisoners based on their religion.The matter was raised in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday when a motion was raised seeking the release of the 36 Muslim prisoners. Almost all opposition parties in the assembly supported the motion, except BJP. Raising the matter in assembly, AIADMK leader Edappadi K Palaniswami urged the state to release them. He cited their health conditions and added that they have been in prison for more than 20 years. Palaniswami said that several political parties had been demanding the release of these prisoners and the state government should heed their plea.Several other MLAs from different parties made similar demands. Responding to the same, CM MK Stalin said that the government has already taken steps to release prisoners. He said that the state government had set up a six-member committee, led by retired Madras High Court judge, Justice N Authinathan, in December 2021 to look into the matter.The panel had recommended the release of 224 prisoners, following which the state decided to first release 49 prisoners, of which 20 were Muslim. The chief minister said the documents on the release were pending with Governor RN Ravi for his assent.Stalin also questioned AIADMK for their sudden demand for the release of Muslim prisoners. “While in power you didn’t take any steps to release Muslim prisoners. You blindly supported CAA and NRC. We and the minority community clearly know why AIADMK is showing such affection towards Muslim prisoners now”, said the CM.On the other hand, BJP has objected to the demand. State BJP chief K Annamalai has cautioned the state government against the premature release of the terrorists serving life imprisonment in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast case. Annamalai said he believed that terrorism shouldn’t be confined to a religion or community.In February 1998, a bomb blast by Radical Islamic Fundamentalists in a serene city like Coimbatore led to the loss of 58 lives and injured over 200.The SC last week stuck down the bail application filed by a few convicts in this case & reiterated it as an atrocious act. Despite…Annamalai wrote on X that he hoped good sense would prevail and Chief Minister M K Stalin would stop “his misadventure of releasing the radical Islamic fundamentalists” from prison.Apart from political parties, other organisations also have joined the demand. Several Muslim organisations held a protest in Chennai on Wednesday, 11 October, demanding the release of 36 Muslim prisoners serving jail terms on terror charges. The protest was led by the Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi (MJK), and it was organised outside the Triplicane mosque in Chennai, India Today reported.Muslim Organisations held protests in Chennai for the release of 36 Muslim prisoners serving life imprisonment for more than 20 years.#ReporterDiary (@PramodMadhav6) pic.twitter.com/Zi7TM9UpltThe Protestors also burnt the image of CM MK Stalin and raised slogans against the government. Later all the protesters were detained by the Chennai police.General Secretary of Manidhaneya Jananayaka Katchi, Taminun Ansari said “We held a protest today in Chennai demanding prisoners who served more than 20 years in Tamil Nadu prison should be released. We also thank the political parties who support our demand. We are shocked that the CM said in the Assembly that they have sent this to the Governor where already 22 bills are pending. We are going to siege the assembly now.”“Rape convicts in Bilkis Bano case were prematurely released by the Gujarat government. They have no moral rights to speak about this”, Thameemul Ansari said justifying the demand.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

4,"12 October, 2023 ","New Karnataka education policy: Yogendra Yadav, the protestor for hire, and Professor Japhet, who drafted anti-superstition bill specifically targeting Hindu rituals, part of committee"," It is notable that the ""Duggal Sahab"" of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers' protest in which he took the avatar of a 'farmer leader' was a ""political stunt"" meant to oust BJP from power.On Wednesday (11th October), the Congress government in Karnataka constituted a committee of ‘experts’ to formulate the Karnataka State Education Policy which would replace the National Education Policy (NEP). The state government has issued a ‘Government Order’ (GO) forming a 15-member committee headed by Professor and former Delhi UGC Chairman Sukhdev Thorat, with a secondary group of eight subject experts/advisers rendering expert input. The committee will submit its report on February 28 next year.“The government is pleased to accord sanction to the State Education Policy Commission for the preparation of a draft Karnataka State Education Policy under the chairmanship of Professor Sukhdev Thorat, an eminent Educationist. Economist, Professor, Writer and Former Chairman of UGC New Delhi,” the GO stated.As per the government circular, the 15-member committee includes- Professor S Japhet, Founding Director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP), Sudhir Krishnaswamy, Vice Chancellor of National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Sharat AnanthaMurthy, Professor, School of Physics, University of Hyderabad, A Narayana, Professor at Azim Premji University’s School of Policy and Governance, among others.Meanwhile, Bhagyavana S Mudigoudra, Special Officer, Department of Higher Education, will be the commission’s Member Secretary, coordinating and maintaining the meeting’s proceedings.Today, the Karnataka Government announced the formation of a 15-member committee tasked with crafting a new education policy for the state. In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established to provide insights and guidance in this endeavour. pic.twitter.com/4Qkms8a342In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established for expert advice. It is interesting to note that the eight-member expert group includes protestor for hire Yogendra Yadav alongside Professor Rahamath Tarikere, Retd Professor in Kannada, Kannada University, Hampi; Professor Janaki Nair, Historian and Retd, Professor at the Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Sonam Wangchuk, Engineer turned Education Reformer and Director of the Himalayan Institute of Alternatives, Ladakh (HIAL), Professor Valerian Rodrigues, and two others.It is notable that the “Duggal Sahab” of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers’ protest in which he took the avatar of a ‘farmer leader’ was a “political stunt” meant to oust BJP from power. Moreover, Yadav had also given a similar statement in a debate on NDTV on 10 March 2022 while discussing the UP Assembly Election results. He said the farmer’s movement led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha played a vital role in building the foundation for the opposition parties to defeat the BJP in UP, however, the opposition parties essentially the Samajwadi Party did not play well.Unsurprisingly, Yogendra Yadav also has links with the controversial financier and regime change specialist George Soros. It is notable that in February this year, George Soros openly expressed his disdain for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of crony capitalism saying that he has good relationships with businessman Gautam Adani. OpIndia has published detailed reports on George Soros’s Open Society Foundations (OSF) which has been backing anti-India elements operating inside India.It is worth noting that previous UGC chairman Sukhdev Thorat, who would lead the aforementioned committee, has been a vocal opponent of reservations for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS). Thorat stated his discontent with the ‘upper caste’ Hindus, primarily Brahmins, “dominating” India’s power structure in an interview with Islamist propaganda portal Maktoob Media. Additionally, he insinuated that caste-based reservations should be applied to the private sector in order to narrow the gap between the upper castes and the SC, ST, and OBCs in terms of indicators like life expectancy, child mortality, etc.It is worth recalling that Professor S Japhet, founding director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP) was a prominent player in drafting the controversial Anti-Superstition Bill, in 2013. It is worth noting that the bill intended to outlaw ‘superstitious practices’ was a pet project of Karnataka CM P Siddaramaiah.The controversial bill aimed to ban practices like made snana which involved any person or persons roll over (uruli seve) on the leaves of leftover food by other persons in any public or religious places or similar practices saying that it violated human dignity. Performing fire walks during Jatras and religious festivals, Baibiga practice which involved piercing of the jaw from one side to another, Mata mantra, Gandra Dora practices for treating snake, scorpion or dog bites etc were deemed inhuman acts.“Creating panic in the minds of the public in general by way of invoking ghosts or mantras. Persuading, propagating or facilitating rituals that involve self-inflicted injuries such as hanging from a hook: inserted into the body (sidi) or pulling a chariot by hook inserted into the body,” the bill stated.While the bill included self-inflicting injuries to define Hindu rituals, the bill did not mention Muharram, an occasion of mourning for the Shia sect of Muslims who inflict injuries to their own bodies using chains and sharp objects in public places. Moreover, the bill mentioned ‘ghosts’ and practices performed on the pretext of expelling them from the person possessed including physical assault and forcing one to perform sexual acts, however, there was no mention of Satan, Shaitan and Jinn and weird practices involved in expelling them from a person ‘possessed’ by them.Back in 2013, Professor Japhet had said that through the bill an attempt has been made to “define the superstitious practices as those that cause grave physical, mental or sexual exploitation or offends human dignity”. It is amusing that Japhet failed to or deliberately did not ‘define’ comparable superstitious practices in other religions.Notably, after much outrage from the people and political parties, the bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature in 2017 when Congress leader Siddaramaiah was the chief minister of Karnataka.Two years before drafting the bill, Japhet wrote an extensive piece on the plight of Dalit Christians in 2011, in which he admitted that Christians from non-Dalit communities discriminate against Christians who convert from Dalit communities. Despite this, S Japhet did not include evangelism and conversion based on the promise of equality as a superstition.The formation of a committee to frame Karnataka state education policy comes after the Congress government had in August announced that its government will implement its own policy rejecting the Centre’s NEP. In May this year, Siddaramiah had said that he would not allow the education sector to be adulterated in the name of the new education policy.Siddaramaiah claimed that the Central Government’s national education agenda is ‘incompatible’ with the federal form of governance. “It has several anomalies that undermine the Constitution and democracy,” remarked the Chief Minister. “Uniform education system does not suit a nation like India which has diverse religions, languages and cultures”. While the chief minister asserted that the NEP will not ‘suit’ India since the country has diverse languages, the NEP directs to lay “emphasis on promoting multilingualism and Indian languages; The medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home language/mother tongue/local language/regional language.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

5,"13 October, 2023 ",Lessons from Hamas’ attack on Israel: The fake ‘Genocide of Muslims’ narrative in India will be used to justify Genocide of Hindus as ‘language of oppressed’," Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door - which they do almost on a regular basisRight before dawn 5 days ago on a Saturday, Israel woke up to her worst nightmare. As the sirens blared and citizens of Israel looked for shelter, a couple of thousand Islamic terrorists from Hamas attacked the bewildered civilians from air, sea and land. As thousands of rockets and missiles rained down on Israel leaving in its wake destruction and a trail of dead bodies strewn on the streets, hundreds of terrorists on motorbikes, on foot and followed by tractors breached the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Simultaneously, terrorists also attached the beaches of Israel riding on motorbikes, overwhelming the unsuspecting Israeli soldiers. As the embers and smoke engulfed Israel, some of the Islamic terrorists descended on paragliders. After descending on Israel, the terrorists went city to city, village to village and kibbutz to kibbutz hunting down women, children and men alike. The visuals from the assault could perhaps be classified as traumatising, but worlds fall short when the Jihadi barbarity is laid threadbare, captured in images of charred bodies, burnt babies, raped and dishonoured women, and bloodied and murdered men. Several Jews were taken hostage by the terrorists as they cried and screamed for help, amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, they were beaten, spat on, dishonoured and kidnapped – carried at the back of their trucks to Gaza. The wound of seeing babies bloodied and murdered is one that Israel and the Jewish community would perhaps never be able to heal from. From babies who slept peacefully in their cribs to partygoers dancing their worries away, where 260 of them were slaughtered, the Muslim terrorists spared none. Amidst the scent of death and blood, the wails of tragic loss, the cries for help and the screams of rage, Israel rose as one. Several Israelis travelled back from wherever they were in the world to seek justice – to seek retribution. Old, young, men and women got called into duty – to defend the civilisational home of the Jews and to ensure those who had the blood of children and women on their hands paid a price for their barbarism. Israel then began to pound Gaza with rockers and missiles, flattening whatever stood in its path. On the 13th of October, Israel asked 1.1 million Palestinians to move from the North to the South – the instruction included for UN officials and those hiding in their premises to relocate as well – signalling that Israel was ready for a ground assault. Israel has also shut down the water and electricity supply of Palestine. Israel pleaded with the world – don’t look away. Look at the biggest onslaught against Jews since the Holocaust. Look at what the Islamic terrorists have done. They have killed our babies. Raped our women. Beheaded our sons. They want us gone – annihilated – murdered – humiliated. Don’t. Look. Away – they pleaded. They pleaded because they knew that as a country that fights for its very survival everyday will not be cowered down and that retribution will be theirs. As expected, when Israel started responding to Palestine’s mass violence against Jews, the narrative was not too kind to them, despite the fact that most countries which often gloss over Islamist violence came out vehemently in support of Israel – USA for example. Almost immediately, the narrative shifted to the brewing humanitarian crisis in Palestine with Israel shutting off its water and electricity supply. In one video, the former Prime Minister of Israel screamed – What is wrong with you? We are fighting the Nazis. How can you expect us to give water and electricity to our enemies”. 'Are you seriously asking me about Palestinian civilians? What is wrong with you? We're fighting Nazis.'Former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett adds 'if Hamas use anyone as a human shield, it is their responsibility.'https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3📺 Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/19nBKjOYOQThe media, however, continued what it does best – whitewash the crimes of Muslims and blame the victims of violence of genocide when they choose to stand up and say – ‘Thus far and no further’. The essence of these articles was simple – Israel is committing a genocide of Palestinians by way of its retaliatory action after Jews were raped, murdered, beheaded or injured. They were careful – though. They were careful to also give a “context” to the Palestinian attack against Israel. In an article headlined, “Palestinian Americans, Dismayed by Violence, Say Historical Context Is Being Overlooked”, The New York Times essentially provided context to the mass murder of rape of Jews by Islamic terrorists. The article said, “In interviews with more than a dozen Palestinian Americans, many said they were saddened by the violence against civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, and hoped for a peaceful resolution. But many said that the underlying causes of the conflict could be traced to the policies of Israel and the United States, and decades of Palestinians being denied freedom of movement and basic rights”. The subtle agenda-pushing is a work of art that must be fully appreciated. In the article, the New York Times essentially pushes the narrative that Palestinians are lovely people who are very very… very sad about the “loss of lives” in Israel. They are empathetic and don’t support terrorism of any form. However, they are also terribly sad that the USA and perhaps the rest of the world are not understanding the historical context of why these lovely, peaceful, delightful people from Palestine raped, beheaded and tortured Jews in Israel. In turn and as a result, while it was the Jews who got raped, beheaded and tortured, it was the Palestinians who were the real victims not only because Israel launched a counteroffensive against them but also because the barbaric, Islamophobic world was refusing to understand why the Palestinians were forced to murder babies, rape women, behead civilians and torture/murder the men. Further in the New York Times article, another Palestinian is quoted saying the following: “These statements are really dehumanizing us,” she said, “and telling us that our lives are not worth anything.” In the eyes of those officials, she added, “we are never the victim, we are always the aggressor.”This statement was made in response to US’ support to Israel and statements demanding action against Hamas for their misadventure. But do you see what happened here? While the entire article asserted that the Muslims were the victims whether they were killing Israelis, facing retaliatory action or celebrating the murder of Jews, the Palestinian quoted here craftily plays victim to negate the incontrovertible fact that Islamic terrorists are indeed the aggressors. While these op-eds try to paint the Islamic terrorists as “Gandhis with guns”, they gloss over the fact that Gaza has been officially ruled by Hamas since 2017. They gloss over the fact that it is not just Hamas – Palestinians take to the streets to celebrate atrocities against Jews on a regular basis. They gloss over the fact that they may attempt to differentiate between Hamas and civilian Palestinians, but even the civilian Palestinians don’t differentiate between the state of Israel and average, civilian Jews because in the Hamas onslaught, celebrated by Palestinians and Muslims across the globe, those killed were average Jews, average Israelis – women, children, elderly. When we look at the incidents in Israel, this is what the apologists want the world to believe. Interestingly, there is an uncanny parallel to how the world arm twists Hindus every time they come under the attack of Islamists. The parallels of the narrative being crafted post-Hamas violence in Israel and the narrative which is crafted every single time Hindus come under the assault of Islamists have several parallels and lessons that Hindus can draw. While Hamas burnt alive Jewish victims in Israel, Dilbar Negi’s hands and legs were chopped off and he was burnt alive by Islamists in India just 3 years ago. The narrative has been eerily constant regardless of established facts – whether we discuss the partition horrors against Hindus or the current aggressions against Hindus. In this regard, it would bode well to remember the case of Mahashay Rajpal, who published Rangeela Rasool and was ultimately assassinated for it. We mostly hear that Mahashay Rajpal was assassinated for publishing a satirical work on Prophet Muhammad called Rangeela Rasool, but we seldom hear why he chose to publish the book. In 1923, Muslims published two particularly offensive books to Hindus. “Krishna teri geeta jalani padegi” used derogatory and vulgar language against Shri Krishna and other Hindu deities and “Uniseevi sadi ka maharshi” which contained derogatory remarks on Arya Samaj founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati (incidentally written by an Ahmadi).In response to this provocation by Islamists, Pandit Chamupati Lal, a close friend of Mahashay Rajpal, wrote a short biography of the Islamic Prophet, Mohammed. “Rangeela Rasool” was a short pamphlet which satirised the life of the Prophet of Islam. Pandit Chamupati made Mahashay Rajpal promise that he would never reveal the name of the author – he knew the consequences of it. Anonymously published under the name “doodh ka doodh aur panee ka panee”, the book enraged Muslims. Staying true to the values of one-way brotherhood, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote in his pamphlet “Young India”, condemning Rangeela Rasool. While Gandhi ignored the provocation by Muslims, by the end of June 1924, the colonial government banned the book. The Muslim community, partly emboldened by MK Gandhi’s endorsement of their hurt sentiments and whitewashing of the provocation against Hindus, filed multiple cases against the book under 153A. In May 1927, Mahashay Rajpal, who published the book, was acquitted of all charges with the court observing that commentary based on facts on historical figures, including the prophet of Islam, cannot be said to promote enmity between groups. As soon as the verdict was delivered, Muslim mobs went into a frenzy. They rioted and demanded the head of Mahashay Rajpal. They were chants about how the murder of Rajpal was acceptable because, under Sharia, the punishment for blasphemy is death.On April 6th, 1929 a 19-year-old carpenter named Ilm ud din stabbed Mahashay Rajpal on his chest eight times while he was seated in the outer verandah of his shop. Though he was offered to give up the name of the author, Pandit Chamupati Lal, during the court proceedings, he refused and did not yield. He paid the price for it. He paid the price for publishing that book despite the court acquitting him and the Muslims getting a special law to protect their fragile feelings. Before Mahashay Rajpal was murdered brutally, the Muslims got their way and got 295A passed by the British, which aimed to protect their ever-outraged feelings. In this case too, it was the Islamists who mounted the initial onslaught by publishing books insulting Hindus. It was the Hindus who published one book in return. The response to that was the Muslims going on a rampage, rioting, committing violence and beheading Mahashay Rajpal. Through it all, it was the Hindus who were condemned by MK Gandhi while the Muslims, who indulged in violence, became the eternal victims getting a law to protect their feelings. Any conversation around this subject, till date, conveniently glosses over the Muslims publishing the two books first and their rampant violence later – what is remembered is that Hindus published a book that hurt Muslims and that Hindus are the community that must be blamed for the murder of Mahashay Rajpal because the Muslim hurt was justified. Not too long after India was torn apart by those who were convinced that the Muslim community could be placated. Before the Rangeela Rasool controversy, Hindus saw the Khilafat movement, and the support it got from Congress and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and after that, Hindus saw the rise of a Muslim leader like Mohammad Ali Jinnah, leading India’s partition.16th August 1946 was the day when the call to massacre Hindus of Bengal was given by Muslim League founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Bengal, the only province in India under Muslim League rule at that time, was apparently chosen by the Muslim League leadership as the suitable place to unleash terror on Hindus in the name of “Direct Action”.In 1946, the massacre of Hindus in Bengal was rather intricately planned. Jinnah is recalled having said that he would either have India divided or India burnt and that he had given up on Constitutional methods to demand the creation of Pakistan. Jinnah had chosen the 16th of August as Direction Action Day because it was the 18th day of Ramzan, the day when the Battle of Badr was fought and won – a war fought by Prophet Muhammad himself, against the Kaffirs, and is considered to be won by Allah’s divine intervention by Muslims. The battle led to the violent occupation of Mecca. On the 16th of August, Calcutta was littered with posters lionising Jinnah and reminding Muslims that they had to follow the footsteps of the Prophet. It is reported that Syed Muhammad Usman, mayor of Calcutta, had issued a widely circulated leaflet that said: Kafer! Toder dhongsher aar deri nei! Sarbik hotyakando ghotbei! (Infidels! Your end is not far away! You will be massacred!). The aim was to make Bengal ‘land of the pure’ and rid it of the Kaffirs (Hindus). The aim was to wage another Battle of Badr, in which the Muslims would conquer the heathens. What followed on the 16th right after the Jumma Namaz is Muslims going on a rampage, beheading Hindus, chopping their limbs off and raping Hindu women. Several women were taken as sex slaves by those who were fighting with the religious fervour of the Battle of Badr. In the Kesoram Cotton Mills at Lichubagan in the Muslim-dominated Metiabruz area, Muslim mobs entered and beheaded over 600 labourers. The Hindus, neutered and asked by Gandhi to die with a smile on their face hardly fought back. There was a mass exodus from Bengal that marked millions fleeing because the massacre seemed too brutal to fight against.When Gopal Patha rose to defend the Hindus, it was MK Gandhi who asked him to lay down his weapons. The retaliatory, self-defence action by the Hindus were deemed the original onslaught and the openly religious violence against the Hindus were pushed under the rug to ensure that the Muslims continued to be the universal and eternal victims. Despite the historical atrocities committed by Muslims against Hindus, today, the Media goes no overdrive trying to push the narrative that there is an impending genocide against Muslims that the world is waiting to witness in India. Reams are written on how Hindus harbour animosity against the Muslims, depriving them of their legitimate rights, lynching them, killing them and humiliating them – building up to a genocide – much like that committed supposedly by Israel against Palestine. History and the current onslaught have been systematically whitewashed by historians, scholars, politicians and the corporate media – to an extent that the world has failed to see the realities of the Hindu population. Let us take the Nuh violence recently for example. Thousands of Muslims had descended on Hindus travelling to an area where the dominant demography was of Muslims. they were travelling there to simply worship Lord Shiva on an auspicious day for Hindus. They were pelted with stones, their cars burnt, held hostage inside the temples where the hostages included women and children and attacked with bullets, acid pouches and petrol bombs. Through it all, the narrative was that somehow, it was the Hindus who had provoked the violence because a) they dared to take out a religious procession in an area where Muslims predominantly live after ghettoizing the area and driving Hindus away and b) because of a rumour that a Hindu activist that the Muslims don’t like might be present at the procession – a lie which was spread by the Islamists themselves. Here is how Le Monde wrote about the Nuh violence. First, they turned one-way violence by the Islamists into “violence between Hindus and Muslims” simply because after the one-way violence, the Hindus had decided to defend themselves. Then, they blamed Hindu organisations for “genocide” and “terror” because they dared to speak about the violence and asserted that they would not accept attacks against Hindus. See a pattern with what is happening in Israel? The Islamists unleash violence. Their violence is justified as the language of the oppressed. When Jews decide to defend themselves and retaliate, they are called the aggressors and the terrorists who unleashed violence continue to be the victims, with the real victims being blamed for unleashing hate and genocide simply because they chose to defend themselves. After the brutal beheading of Kanhaiya Lal by two Muslims who then uploaded the beheading video on social media, holding the blood-dripping knife, global media blamed Hindus for asserting that their lives matter too. Here is what the TIME published. At the very onset, author Mansoor shifted the discourse from the beheading of Kanhaiya Lal to supposed ‘chilling calls for revenge’ against the ‘marginalised’ Muslim population. While trying to contextualise the murder of Kanhaiya Lal, Sanya Mansoor suggested that the poor Hindu tailor had drawn the wrath of the Islamists upon himself by supporting the ‘derogatory comments’ of ex-BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma. Meanwhile, Mansoor also tried to shield the co-religionists of the killers and praise them for their token condemnations. “Muslim politicians and Islamic preachers swiftly condemned the killing,” she asserted while conveniently ignoring their collective silence over calls of ‘Sarr tan se juda chants all over India backed by the same people.Do you see the parallels? Here they are: When a Muslim gets lynched because he was a thief and primarily for such reasons, the media and the global world order are quick to call it an onslaught against Muslims by Hindus, however, when Hindus are lynched, beheaded, raped and murdered for explicitly religious reasons amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, the Hindus have been historically blamed for the violence by the Muslims claiming that the Muslims are indulging in violence because the Hindus have somehow enraged them enough to go on a justified murderous rampage. To prove their point, they even invent crimes where they claim Muslims were beaten up amid Hindu religious slogans simply to justify crimes against Hindus amid chants of Allahu Akbar. They’re lies, screamed from the mountaintops versus our truths meekly repeated, with nobody to listen to us – that is the battle that Hindus have been fighting for millennia. History shows that progressively, a violent minority has strengthened the legislative, judicial and societal cover it gets to assert its religious supremacy aspirations. These aspirations are often negotiated after a violent, vehement and shameless assertion of street veto. The State and leaders who are meant to protect Bharat have bent a knee to the street veto and tried their damndest to assuage the perennially offended, the often violent and the perpetually demanding lot. Their constitutional special status keeps getting reaffirmed either by politicians or the judiciary in the hopes that the ever-so-offended lot will not take to the streets and indulge in rampant violence which the state is woefully incapable of controlling simply to prove just how downtrodden and oppressed they truly are. The intolerant minority has often held a sword to Hindus’ neck and forced us to concede that we have oppressed the sword-wielders.In this bargain, the global world order and the media has followed the pattern of demonising the victims of Islamic violence – the Hindus – and paint the aggressors – the Islamists – and the perpetual victims. In the case of Israel, we see large acceptance of their persecution and acknowledgement of her right to retaliate. Even then, the narrative demonising the Jews for fighting for their survival and civilisational identity is strong enough to spark violence and protests against the victims. Hindus have failed to do what the Jews have done spectacularly well – make the world aware of their own genocide, and their own persecution and ensure that normalisation of that hate is not only a punishable offence but one for which the society itself might ostracise you. We saw that play out after Hamas’ attack against Israel – those students from Harvard who blamed Israel for the terror attack against Jews by Islamic terrorists were forced to retract their statements because corporations started pulling away their job offers. The USA – which when it comes to India whitewashes the Islamic terrorists, was grieved and stood firmly behind Israel’s right to self-defence. The Muslim nations that wanted Israel wiped out mostly stood by mute because they knew the world stood by Israel and her right to self-preservation. As Israel flattens Palestine, there is recognition to some extent that the Jews, especially after suffering from the horrors of the Holocaust, will not stand by and get wiped out again. In India, however, partly because of the failure of Hindus themselves and the systematic whitewashing of history and news by scholars, political leaders and the corporate media, wails of persecution often go unnoticed. In fact, they don’t just go unnoticed, the narrative that we see media, Islamists and Leftists build against Israel today, is a constant against India with other players supporting Israel today joining in as well. Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door – which they do almost on a regular basis – because our own leaders are a part of the narrative demonising Hindus. Take Rahul Gandhi for example and how he today shields Islamists by calling IUML secular, endorsing calls to wipe out Sanatan Dharma, seeking foreign intervention to stop the Hindus and a caste census back home to divide the persecuted. The world will look away as Hindus get slaughtered and the narrative being crafted will blame Hindus for their own persecution and genocide, claiming that the violence unleashed by the Islamists is the “Language of the oppressed” – they are doing that today with Israel – but it would be far easier to do it with Hindus because, unlike Israel, we have traitors amongst ourselves and a world that has normalised persecution of Hindus after we failed to talk about our own plight for centuries. Today, far more than ever, Hindus need to learn from the Jews. Bharat needs to learn from Israel. If we don’t talk about our own persecution – nobody will. If we don’t protect our honour – nobody will. If we don’t stand up to our murderers being painted as the victims – nobody will. And if today we don’t realise the threats of Islamic terror and how it comes even for those who weep for the self-proclaimed marginalised Islamists today. The Hindus’ collective right to retain the cultural, religious and ethical integrity of the only land they have has to be held sacrosanct – legislatively, judicially and socially. This is, perhaps, the one lesson that Israel can teach us – that history is screaming out, waiting for Hindus to hear. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

6,"10 October, 2023 ","There is no common brotherhood, only ‘common enemy’: How the Ummah ignores millions of Muslim victims but gets together against Jews, Hindus, and Christians"," There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians.Since Israel declared war following the Hamas terrorist attacks and ground invasion, the majority of the Arab world has rallied in support of Palestine. These countries have a long history of supporting the “Palestinian” cause. However, their support doesn’t stem from the perceived notion of religious fraternity and common brotherhood, colloquially referred to as the concept of Ummah instead it is driven by the hatred for dehumanised non-believers, pejoratively called ‘Kafirs’ (infidels) and shared theological believe of a common enemy. Conspicuously, the responses of the Arab world vis-a-vis alleged atrocities on Muslims by non-believers as against that of Muslims on Muslims underscores the exploitative and preposterous concept called “convenience of victimhood” to serve the end goal of justifying the ‘annihilation’ of non-believers. Here are some antecedents revealing how support for Palestine or Muslims being ‘persecuted’ around the world serves as just a tool to usher in Dar-ul-Islam and make the world ridden from infidelity.  Israel-Palestine neighbours Syria, Egypt, and Jordan among others have fought wars citing the cause of Palestinians, however, they all share a dark history of persecuting Palestinians on their soil or mercilessly committing crimes against the population, which they allege Israel commits against Palestinian Muslims. Evidently, on 17th September 1970, Jordan carried out a massacre of thousands of Palestinians which is notorious as ‘Black September’ for Palestinians. Fifty years ago, King Hussein ordered the Jordanian Army to massacre militants in the refugee camps situated around Amman. Following the royal orders, the Jordanian army launched a brutal crackdown in a bid to retake control of territory occupied by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Jordan.  According to the 2015 census data, there are around 634,000 Palestinians in Jordan out of the total population of 9.5 million. However, Human Rights organisations claim that half of the Jordan population is Palestinian. The ruling Hashemite dynasty of Jordan fears the large population of Palestinians in the country has the power to destabilise the empire.Meanwhile, Pakistan has a deep interest in supporting the Palestinian cause which increased, especially after India started strengthening its relationship with Israel in the 1990s. However, Pakistani leaders have avoided discussing this chapter in Palestinian history: the events of Black September in Jordan in 1970. Notably, Pakistan played a major hand in exterminating Palestinian ‘terrorists’ hiding in refugee camps. Jordan had sought the assistance of Pakistan to train its newly equipped army. As a result, the critical training for the Jordanian army was provided by Pakistan.Another neighbor, Syria which earlier used to mollycoddle Hamas, it acted against Palestinians when they exploited and aggravated civil war in Syria, the nation which was hosting them. Apparently, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. However, normal Gazans or Palestinians didn’t share the same fate as their top brass for participating in the Syrian Civil War. While the Hamas leadership was just shunned from the country, ordinary Palestinians (despite hailing from the Muslim faith) were brutally hacked to death. According to private data gathered by the Action Group for Palestinians of Syria (AGPS), they documented the death of at least 4,013 Palestinians as a result of the war in Syria. The victims included 614 refugees who had died of torture inside Syrian regime prisons and detention centres and 205 who had died due to lack of medical care and the tight siege imposed by the Syrian regime army on the Yarmouk camp in Damascus, the AGPS had revealed. Israeli politician Golda Meir once famously said, “We will have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us”. The same does not just apply to Islamic countries, it also applies to Hamas (Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya) which uses the civilian population of Gazans to materialize their hatred for Jews.Notably, Hamas has been using civilian sites like hospitals, religious sites, or educational institutions to launch rocket or missile attacks and exploit civilians as cannon fodder. The Israeli Defence Forces demonstrated an example of a religious site that was hit by the Israeli Air Force as it was used by Hamas to launch a terror attack on Israel.Israeli civilians are not Hamas’ only victim.Hamas intentionally positions itself deep among Gaza's population. For example…this terrorist site that the Israel Air Force targeted, located next to a mosque and just a football field away from a school. pic.twitter.com/ROs3iMdnLzThe Rafah Border Crossing, also known as the Rafah Crossing Point, serves as the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. It is located on the Gaza–Egypt border, which was recognised by the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty. However, Egypt has a long history of prohibiting Gazan refugees from entering its territory to avoid its negative security implications. Cairo which has suffered the brunt of Islamic State (IS) or Daesh, has feared infiltration of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Palestinians, particularly Gazan refugees. Even today, soon after the Hamas terrorists imposed an unprovoked war on Israel, Egyptian security closed this sole border crossing for Gazans. The reports of it were confirmed by the Israeli officials who had earlier asked the Gazans to cross over to Egypt in the wake of its retaliatory strikes on Hamas terror sites. However, later they had to clarify that the Rafah crossing was open yesterday, but now it is closed.BREAKING: Egypt has closed the Rafah crossing with Gaza's southern borderThe Rafah border crossing has remained predominantly closed since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007. Even when Egypt makes some concessions, it only allows those who require medical treatment or have foreign residency permits to cross the borders, a move targeted toward Hamas terrorists. Do you know why #Egypt doesn't open the #Rafah border crossing with #Gaza to let 2.3 million Palestinians living there flee? This is because 8 out of every 10 Palestinian men living in #Gaza are terrorists or terrorism supporters! For years, Egypt has suffered from #ISIL/#Daesh,… pic.twitter.com/zD0C89d7pAStrikingly, the Egyptian fear revolving around the entry of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Gazan refugees stems from the fact that Hamas has in the past targeted the Rafah border and Egyptian border personnel including blowing it up with explosives. One such incident was reported on 23 January 2008, when Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah border crossing, destroying part of the 2003 wall.Meanwhile, Israel had already sealed its border crossings with the Palestinian enclave, allowing in only humanitarian aid and basic supplies which have been cut post the 7th October Hamas terrorist attack on Israeli citizens.Earlier, Hamas used to amass funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Notably, Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south and Rafah is the sole border crossing. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is again a dreaded and designated terrorist organisation.  Afterward, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Recently, Jordan implemented a policy that can’t be further from the concept of “Common brotherhood” or the antithesis of catering to the Ummah brotherhood. Evidently, Jordan which was perceived as a host accepting millions of Palestinian, Iraqi, and Syrian refugees on the lines of the Universal Muslim Brotherhood, had taken a hard turn. Experts have pointed out that the “Jordan Initiative” unveiled in May will radically change Jordan from one of the world’s most accommodating hosts to one of its biggest proponents for sending refugees home. Regarding this, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch, Adam Coogle said, “Jordan long has said that refugees are welcome. But now the official rhetoric has moved toward supporting their return. It’s a cause for significant concern.”Similarly, Lebanon and Turkey have speeded up the deportation of hundreds of Syrians, their Muslim brethren, since April to speed up their exodus from their so-called “pro-Ummah” nation.  Likewise, Pakistan, the vociferous proponent of Ummah, has recently asked millions of Afghan refugees to leave the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Afghan refugees who had fled their nation when the Taliban took over Kabul and had been living in Pakistan have been reportedly given only four weeks time to return, forcing them to choose between the brutalities of two co-religionist nations, Pakistan or Afghanistan.  On the basis of Ummah, persecuted Muslim citizens/refugees of war-torn Yemen should have garnered the same support as they have been suffering from a brutal war, starvation, and cholera that have been ruining lives. However, this is not the case because co-religionists are involved in this war and there is no “convenience of victimhood” involved in the Yemeni conflict to furtherance the cause of Dar-ul-Islam or fighting/killing the infidel. There is a war in Yemen, there is a war in Syria, there is a war in Sudan, and there is a war in Lybia. Muslims are killing Muslims in all these wars, thousands of victims, did you see any protests in New York, London, Berlin, ..? Why?Because for many Muslims they do not really…The same goes for Syrian, Sudanese, and Libyan refugees, Muslims being persecuted by terrorism in Africa and elsewhere, attract no whispers of support as they don’t have the binding clue – common enemy. Islamic nations like Pakistan, Iran, Turkiye, Palestine, Lebanon, etc have committed sins on their own native Muslim sects – Ahmediyas, Balochs, and Sindhis etc in Pakistan, Hamas killing dissenting Muslims and Fatah leadership, etc. Fighting for common brotherhood, persecuted Muslims and atrocities, and ethnic cleansing in Muslim countries by Muslim leadership have always been brushed under the carpet.     Instead, the outcry for atrocities is targeted at non-believers for causing hindrance to their dehumanising and Jihadi acts –reflected in the anti-Semitic, anti-Hindu, anti-Western (Christ-believing countries) calls, like “Gas the Jews”, asking Pakistanis to kill ‘Hindus’, death to Israel and “death to America” in the Iranian parliament.  Palestinian Islamic Scholar Nidhal Siam's Anti Hindu speechAnd they're Supporting Palestine pic.twitter.com/fdsQQGgs0hThe latest hatred towards the “common enemy” is clear from the fact that the Arab world has refrained from condemning the propensity of crime committed on innocent Israeli citizens. On 7th October, Hamas terrorists launched a war involving rocket barrages and ground invasion into Israeli territories killing unsuspecting Israelis and other foreign nationals present in their sight. In the catastrophic invasion of Israel, more than 700 Israeli citizens have lost their lives, hundreds of children, girls, and the elderly have been taken hostage with Hamas terrorists giving open threats to behead them and air the beheadings, rape being used as weapons of war, bared and bruised bodies of women being paraded in streets. Conspicuously, these assaults were inflicted on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians. Be it Australia or Canada, the UK or the USA, the Palestinian cause has seen overwhelming support. However, the same people have never stood for the millions of malnourished children in Yemen, they never cared for the little girls deprived of schooling in Afghanistan, or the Muslims victimized by terrorists in Africa. The global Muslim population conspicuously lacks concerns for legitimate human rights abuses and atrocities when the perpetrators are their own people. It only unites when the enemy is the “other”, the Jew, the Hindu, or the Christian. Simply put, they just want to see the end of non-believers, one excruciating death after another and Jews had always been the first in line followed by Hindus and Christians with rejected/outcasted Muslim sects like Ahmediyas in between. Iran’s fanatism to have nuclear power demonstrates that it just wants to destroy the Jewish state and to achieve that it is ready to spend dozens of Gazas and Palestinians and Lebanon etc. The first hallucination of the usage of nuclear arsenal will be on Israel, taking away the existence of their beloved Palestinian Muslim brethren, for whom such wars are claimed to be fought for and such brutality are being justified.    Meanwhile, in the non-Arab world, leaders from across the world, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden have expressed their solidarity and support for Israel at its difficult hour. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Common victimhood has become a tool, while common brotherhood is just a blatant lie, the only thing that unites the Muslim world, in general, is the hatred of the ‘common enemy’ – Israel, followed by Hindus and Christians with outcasted Muslim sects in between.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

7,"6 October, 2023 ",The Hindu and how it is creating the North-South Divide: Repeatedly lying about devolution of funds and cheating their readers with misinformation," Instead of focusing on meaningful criticism, our English media has now been reduced to repeatedly lying and cheating their readers. It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too. Thankfully, the citizens of our country are much more intelligent than these hate-mongers in the English media. The Hindu published an article on 5th October 2023, with a very combative headline – “Retribution for the South, accolade for the North”. I think you got the gist just by looking at the headline. This article was a continuation of the oft-repeated argument by this ilk, that South India is superior to North India and yet the Government of India keeps rewarding North India and ignores South India.This particular article discusses the divisive argument through two subjects – the Delimitation of Lok Sabha Constituencies and the devolution of funds through Finance Commissions. While discussing these two subjects, the article stands out for some really unique arguments. The first is how it changes our understanding of basic geography itself. Sample this core argument at the beginning of the article:The authors, one of whom is a professor, have miraculously decided that the Gujarati-speaking Western state of Gujarat is actually a Hindi-speaking Northern State for the sake of their argument. I kept on thinking as to why they would make this fundamental error. Is it to bolster their argument that the 4% increase in population in a certain group of states is because of Gujarat? Turns out, it is not. Even if Gujarat is not included in this elite list, the core argument (a 4% increase in population share) will stay as strong. This is not the first time this ilk has tried to alter our fundamental understanding of Geography. Prashant Kishor, in an interview with Shekhar Gupta, enlightens us that “Hindi heartland has now extended to Western India in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka”. How does Karnataka remotely get classified as a “Hindi heartland” and more importantly a “Western state”? How do Gujarat and Maharashtra get into the bracket of “Hindi heartland” when crores of people in these states speak and take pride in their own languages? Can you imagine if powerful commentators (such as Shekhar Gupta) and publications (such as The Hindu) could lie like this in today’s day and age, what must they have done back then when they were even more powerful? It is perplexing that they think their reader will not see through this chicanery. This bogey of labelling random states as “Hindi speaking” and altering their geography, merely because they vote for the BJP is really a sad reflection of the mental state of these commentators. But why exactly are they altering the fundamentals of geography like this? The essence is captured in these two paragraphs – South Indian states will lose out on their share of representation in the Lok Sabha post delimitation. Recently, India Today also put up a graphic on their website giving out some numbers on how South’s representation will come down if population is the criteria. This was dutifully picked up by the divisive politicians from the South. All of them are making one fundamental assumption that the number of Lok Sabha seats will remain constant at 543. It has been discussed at various forums that the number of Lok Sabha seats will increase from the current 543. It doesn’t make sense for us to have the same number of seats when our population was 50 crores versus when it is 140 crores! The new Lok Sabha building can accommodate 888 MPs – surely, they have built it with the purpose of increasing the seats from the existing 545. Instead of telling the readers about these possibilities, the English media is purposely fomenting hatred by discussing only one remote possibility.  Now, the authors of The Hindu could not fill up enough space with only one bogus argument, so they decided to repeat the lie about the devolution of funds through the 15th Finance Commission (FC). The core argument is just in one paragraph highlighted below:From 1975 till 2015, all finance commissions (7th to 13th) took the 1971 census as a reference. You must actually be wondering what relevance would the 1971 census have in 2015. This statistic actually reflects the status quoist mindset of the Congress party. But we digress. The Modi government did the logical thing of mandating to partial use the latest 2011 census data from 2015-2020 (14th FC) and fully use it from 2020 onwards (15th FC). Ever since this gang started screaming that the South States “lost the advantage despite doing good on population control. Controversial website Wire even went to the extent of claiming that “It is becoming almost untenable for Tamil Nadu and Kerala to thrive in the Indian union as rational, self-interested sub-units.”On peripheral reading, you would actually think that this is a logical argument and be wondering why I am being so banal about it. In fact, if you read the article snippet pasted above from The Hindu, you would also assume that the Modi government hasn’t incorporated this logical argument at all, and is, therefore, anti-South India, fascist and whatnot. Guess what? The 15th Finance Commission has reduced the weightage allotted to only the population and has added a new criterion to actually reward states that have done well on controlling the population. Take a look at the comparison table below (the highlighted portion indicates the new criteria).Demographic Performance refers to how states have performed with respect to population control. Simply put, you will be rewarded if you control your population better – which is exactly what the article in The Hindu is arguing for! The “tax effort” incentivizes states that have done well in tax collection efforts. This parameter is back in the 15th FC (after not being considered in the previous 3 FCs). The moot question therefore is this – Why have the authors of The Hindu piece intentionally not told the readers about this most important piece of information? Why have the editors published this lie-filled article when the fundamental premise itself has no basis? What do these people gain by fomenting such hate between regions of India? If anything, the Narendra Modi government has revolutionized the manner in which funds are devolved to the states. The states used to get 32% of the central share until the 13th FC period (ends 2015). From 2015 onwards, the states got a whopping 41% share. The percentage increase in the share is one aspect. Because of buoyant tax collections, as part of this 41% share, the states received a whopping 69.60 lakh crores (2014 to 2023) as opposed to just 18.50 lakh crores in the 2004 to 2014 period. Instead of focusing on meaningful criticism, our English media has now been reduced to repeatedly lying and cheating their readers. It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too. Thankfully, the citizens of our country are much more intelligent than these hate-mongers in the English media. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

8,"4 October, 2023 ","From KCR’s offer to join NDA to Tribal Uni, a promise made by UPA: Two Telangana visits, explosive revelations by PM Modi will change the political game"," No one in Telangana was ready for the political bombshells or the administrative surprises. It is now up to the state BJP unit to take this message forward. Will these get converted to votes? Time will only tell! Even by Prime Minister Modi’s hectic travel standards, it is unlikely that he will visit the same state in a span of 3 days. So, when his itinerary was announced for his visits to Telangana on October 1st and 3rd, it certainly created excitement amongst the cadre and inquisitiveness among the media. And true to the expectations, Prime Minister Modi made some explosive revelations and announced some critical projects that are bound to change the nature of discourse in Telangana politics. On October 3rd, Prime Minister Modi revealed that Chief Minister KCR had approached him, after BRS’s loss in GHMC elections in the year 2020, with an offer to join the NDA in exchange for support in the GHMC council. He has also asked the media to check out the dates to validate his claim (the dates do check out. The results were declared on December 5th, and KCR met Modi on Dec. 12th). This offer was rejected by the Prime Minister and the BJP chose to sit in the opposition. Prime Minister Modi has also told us that KCR informed him that he plans to make KTR the CM and wanted Modi’s blessings for the same. The timing of this revelation also checks out because there were multiple leaks to the media in January 2021 that the coronation of KTR is right around the corner. The idea had to be dropped by KCR owing to severe resistance from within the party and his extended family too. The Prime Minister’s revelations have to be seen in the context of the growing narrative in the state that the BRS and BJP are friends and not foes! The mind really boggles at how the Congress party was very successful in spreading this narrative. The chief reason being cited was that despite multiple interrogations by the ED, KCR’s daughter Kavitha has not been arrested yet in the now famous Delhi Liquor Scam. The ED chargesheet does talk about a “South Group” of which Kavitha is a part, that arranged for 100 crores in bribes in exchange for licenses. The BJP cadre was finding it very difficult to counter this argument. And around the same time, the popular and vociferous BJP President Bandi Sanjay Kumar was replaced – thus adding more fuel to the narrative that this was done at the behest of a BRS-BJP understanding! The Prime Minister’s revelations have certainly come as a boost for the party cadre, but his announcements on October 1st in Telangana were no less significant and were equally narrative-setting in nature. Until the year 2021, Telangana was the highest turmeric-producing state in India. The people of Nizamabad district had a demand for nearly 15 years that a Turmeric board be set up in Nizamabad so that the turmeric farmers here get better opportunities and rates to sell Turmeric. There is this farmer who took a vow in the year 2011 that he will walk barefoot till the Turmeric Board is set up in Nizamabad. KCR’s daughter, Kavitha fought the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Nizamabad promising them that she will bring the Turmeric board. She failed to do so (among her many failures) and she eventually lost the 2019 election to BJP’s Dharmapuri Arvind.D. Arvind signed a bond paper to the people of Nizamabad that he would resign if he failed to bring the Turmeric Board and also a good MSP for Turmeric. Though the central government announced the setting up of a Spices Board regional office in Nizamabad, it didn’t cut any ice with the voters. As has been the trend with the Modi government, where long pending issues are resolved quickly, Prime Minister Modi has announced on October 1st, the setting up of the National Turmeric Board in Nizamabad. This took the BRS by surprise because they were all busy making jokes about how Arvind failed to get the Turmeric board and how his bond paper was now a joke. With this announcement, one of the key demands of thousands of farmers in Nizamabad stands fulfilled. In fact, the setting up of a Turmeric board in general has been a demand even in the states of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. This is the first time in 36 years that a board is being set up specifically for a product. The second major announcement was of setting up a Central Tribal University in Telangana. You may be wondering what is so major about setting up a university. This university was promised in the AP Reorganisation Act of 2014 bought by the UPA. Despite swift approvals from the Modi government, the BRS government delayed land acquisition. And yet BRS started shouting from the rooftops that it is the Modi government that is doing grave injustice to Telangana by not granting the university! After 9 years of dilly-dallying by the KCR government (nicely captured in this thread), the Central Tribal University has finally become a reality. The Prime Minister had to make repeated mentions of the Congress party (both in his speeches and tweets) in these two days because it was important to remind people of the corrupt and inept Congress party. These steps were necessitated also because of both the stagnating fortunes of the BJP and the rise of the Congress in Telangana. No one in Telangana was ready for the political bombshells or the administrative surprises. It is now up to the state BJP unit to take this message forward. Will these get converted to votes? Time will only tell! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

9,"2 October, 2023 ","Son of a Congress leader, Fareed Zakaria, who had called for foreign interference in India, now whitewashes Khalistani terrorist Nijjar"," While explaining to his audience why India was accusing Canada of providing a safe haven to terrorists, he downplays the Khalistani terrorism in the name of a separate homeland, ‘Khalistan’. On Monday (October 2), CNN released an episode of India-born US journalist Fareed Zakaria pontificating on the diplomatic row between India and Canada following Justin Trudeau’s absurd allegations against New Delhi. In the 5-minute video, the son of Former Congress Minister Rafiq Zakaria, Fareed Zakaria goes on at length to whitewash Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. He trivialises the real threat of Khalistani terrorism by casting aspersions over the authenticity and gravity of the danger they pose to India’s national security and the lives of patriotic Indians inside and outside India.  Today’s last look: why Trudeau’s startling allegations are playing out very differently in Modi’s India pic.twitter.com/brVKd0QjzoZakaria also accused India of indulging in jingoism over the Canadian allegation and implies that the Khalistani terrorism issue is being exaggerated for political gains by PM Modi and BJP in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections in 2024. Zakaria begins by quoting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, where he had accused India of being involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil. He then goes on to whitewash Hardeep Singh Nijjar by briefly describing him as a Sikh “activist” and head of a Sikh temple (Gurudwara) and tries to say that he was gunned down by unidentified assailants in June in the temple’s parking lot. Zakaria sidestepped the fact that Nijjar had an Interpol arrest warrant against his name as early as November 2014 for being involved in serious offenses like murder, among a host of other illegal activities. Zakaria deliberately omits the fact that Trudeau was pandering to Khalistani terrorists by raising the issue of Khalistani terrorist Nijjar’s killing with India for political reasons. While giving a political spin to India’s response to the issue, he didn’t mention the alliance between the NDP and the Liberal party. Jagmeet Singh’s NDP is a known party of Khalistani sympathisers in India.Instead, he presented Trudeau’s absurd allegations against India as a move to get Justice for Nijjar. He claimed that the motive of Justin Trudeau in making these allegations was to shame the Indian government by airing these allegations publicly and compel it to cooperate in the investigation.  In fact, he had earlier given a call to the US government to directly interfere in India’s internal affairs. He advocated for (the US govt) to ally with India’s businesses, press, NGOs, and cultural groups, indirectly hinting that the US government should invest in regime change tactics instead of seeking healthy bilateral relations with India. Back then, he had also targeted India for focusing on its own national interest insinuating that the ideal ally of the US should prioritise US interests above its own interests.Later in the video, he delves into, “why Trudeau’s startling allegations are playing out very differently in Modi’s India”. Citing some snippets from Indian media and political analysts, he laments that these stories have “released a spasm of Jingoism”. He then goes on to paint a contrasting picture of Canada as seen from a Western lens vis-a-vis how India has started to portray Canada as – “a safe haven for terrorists.”  In the video, Zakaria states, “In India, the reactions are very different and reveal in fact that Justin Trudeau blew it. Just look at the Indian press, the story has released a spasm of Jingoism in which TV anchors cast Canada not as a multicultural haven and stable democracy, you and I may know but as a rogue state bent on protecting terrorists.” To highlight this point, he plays the clip of Arnab Goswami where he referred to Justin Trudeau as a supporter of terrorism, an open terror backer, and a terrorist sympathiser and added that he is at the point of no return. Zakaria argues that political analyst Sushant Sareen has aptly described the Country’s reaction, “if we did it, it was right, if we didn’t do it, you are wrong.” If we did it, it was right; if we didn’t, you were wrong https://t.co/0btTVWeAlDArguing that with this case, India is misrepresenting itself as a victim of Western bullying on the domestic front, Zakaria added, “An analysis peace of the Hindustan Times conjures up memories of Western colonial powers ganging up against India claiming that Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s killing will be a rallying point for the Anglo-Saxon bloc to come together against India.”  While explaining to his audience why India was accusing Canada of providing a safe haven to terrorists, he downplays the Khalistani terrorism in the name of a separate homeland, ‘Khalistan’. He blatantly lies by mainstreaming the fringe Khalistanis by claiming that Nijjar was one among many foreign-based Sikhs who advocate for Khalistan.    Regarding this, he said, “Indian officials have accused Canada of providing a safe haven for terrorists, that might sound like a puzzling and absurd allegation but it is a reference to the fact that Nijjar was a Sikh separatist. One of many Sikhs abroad who advocate for a separate country for Sikhs, the homeland they want to create, Khalistan, the idea that goes back decades, the efforts include armed militancy in India that peaked in the 1980s.”  Subsequently, he whitewashes the ongoing crimes and public calls for violence against Hindus by Khalistani elements. For this, he mischievously downplays by quoting The Economist which claimed that Khalistan is merely an “idle talking point” in the Sikh diaspora.    He said, “As the Economist notes, the movement for Khalistan was responsible for the death of thousands in the 1980s and 1990s but has since been little more than an idle talking point in the Sikh diaspora and has negligible support in India.”Casting aspersions on India’s concern regarding national security and the lives of Indian nationals abroad, Fareed Zakaria goes on to say that Canada catering to India’s demand to act tough on Khalistani elements would be “politically useful” for PM Modi and BJP.  He said, “Whatever the reality in this one case, tensions between India and Canada over “Sikh activists” in the Indian diaspora have been long-running. As the FT notes, India’s accusations that Canada has been too soft on “Sikh activists” deserve some scrutiny. But it is also true that playing up this kind of threat to India is politically useful for PM Narendra Modi and his party BJP.”  Citing the example of the Pulwama terror attack and subsequent response by India, he argues that Trudeau’s strategy to seek justice by naming and shaming India is fundamentally flawed. Painting ‘Hindu Nationalism’ as anti-minority and anti-West, he sermonises, “You see Justin Trudeau’s whole strategy of naming and shaming India fundamentally misunderstands the dynamics of Modi’s Hindu nationalism which is rooted in the belief that India’s Hindu majority has been passive for too long in the face of minorities and foreigners. When presented with an opportunity, Modi knows how to translate it into political gold.”  He continued, “In 2019 a suicide bomber carried out the worst attack in decades killing dozens of Indian soldiers, India blamed Pakistan militants and sent in the Indian Airforce and carried out strikes on what it said was a militant training facility in Pakistan. Though Pakistan denied the strikes hit much of anything. Nonetheless, it was the first time that such a cross-border operation had been carried out in almost fifty years.”  Connecting the dots of then vs. now, and indirectly underscoring the fact that Canada is becoming new Pakistan for India, Zakaria concluded by lamenting that this portrayal that Modi is standing against Sikh separatism and Western bullying will be an election plank for him, regardless that it might not be real or dangerous.  Fareed Zakaria ranted, “As Bloomberg noted, Modi went on a victory lap, saying in a campaign speech that he believed in barging into the house of terrorists and killing them. He implied without any evidence that the opposition parties’ sympathies lay with the terrorists. Pollsters reported a boost in Modi’s approval ratings after the strike. Now Modi faces another election, and he will surely be helped if he can run by standing against Sikh separatism and Western bullying, regardless of how real or dangerous either threat actually is.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

10,"13 October, 2023 ",Did a Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire while burning the Israeli flag? Know the truth behind the video which has gone viral," The video is an old one from 2021 and the incident happened during the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran in May that year.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in mass genocide, killing over 1300 Israelis and injuring hundreds more. As the Israel-Hamas war rages, a video went viral which showed a man unintentionally lighting himself on fire while burning an Israeli flag.The video has been widely shared on X since yesterday (October 12), with most of the users alleging that it was a Hamas supporter who attempted to burn the Israeli flag amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. They mocked the Hamas supporter saying that Karma paid him back. An X user @Hariindic shared the video with the caption, “Look at the current situation of Hamas – Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire! Karma works wonders.”#Hamas situation right now😂🇮🇱🇵🇸 WATCH: Hamas supporter accidentally sets himself on fire! Karma acts in wonderful ways.#Israel #IsraelPalestineWar #HamasMassacre #GazaUnderAttack #HamasTerrorism #Gaza_under_attack #HamasTerrorists #Palestine #GazaUnderAttack #Gaza pic.twitter.com/4pNnGgG6CbIn the footage, a man is seen holding a massive Israeli flag. Another man approached the man who was holding the flag and set it on fire. Within seconds, due to the direction of the wind, the clothes of the man who is holding the flag also catch fire. The man immediately drops the flag on the ground and scampers away after his clothes catch fire. Amusingly, the group of protestors who were seen standing beside him holding Palestinian flags, instead of coming to his rescue, quickly moved away from him to save themselves from the fire.Though the video was being shared extensively on X, formally Twitter, OpIndia decided to do some investigation, after which we learned that the video was an old one that resurfaced in the midst of the recent Israel-Hamas confrontation. Even in 2021, the same video was shared by numerous social media accounts. The majority of these accounts belonged to Muslim people who had posted the video to express their hostility towards Israelis.خداوندا مارا از دست پیروانت نجات بده.God, save us from your followers pic.twitter.com/T3xGT5ImJyIn fact, the Times of Israel reported about the incident in May 2021. The media report shared the same video posted by several X users then, claiming that the video was from the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran on May 7 2021.Let us inform you that in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution, Iran established Al-Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day. The Iranian government marks the day with anti-Israel rallies, demonstrations, and threats to “liberate” Jerusalem from Israeli rule.In conclusion, despite the fact that the video has recently gone viral amid the ongoing Israel and Hamas war, it is an old one from Iran and does not feature any Hamas supporters or terrorists. Though here too, the Israeli flag was burnt in a show of sympathy for Palestine and a show of anger against Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

11,"7 October, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did 121 people die because of the shutting down of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi," Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. Days after the Allahabad High Court stayed the suspension on the licence of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi, social media was rife with disinformation about the death of 121 people in the Munshiganj area of the city.On Friday (6th October), a propaganda news outlet by the name of ‘4 pm’ interviewed an alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, who made outrageous claims about the death of 121 patients due to lack of medical attention.An alleged nursing staffer by the name of Saurabh Mishra claimed that a whopping 121 residents of Amethi died due to the closure of the hospital. “Some are dying en route to Lucknow, others are not getting medicines on time. There are not even cotton swabs and bandages,” he claimed “Around 121 patients have died in just 15 days,” Mishra continued. “This is the politics of vengeance…They (BJP) hate Gandhis,” he brazened out. Prior to him, another alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital named Umashankar Pandey claimed that the licence of the medical facility was suspended due to the BJP’s disdain for the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.“Smriti Irani (MP from Amethi constituency) hates the fact that ‘Gandhi’ name is attached to the hospital. Now, they (BJP) are hurting the employability of small-time workers,” he was heard as saying. After the clips of the video went viral online, the Congress system exploited the opportunity to create hysteria about the supposed death of more than 120 people in Amethi.It must be mentioned that the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi is run by the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Trust (SGMT), which is headed by Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi.Congress loyalist Shantanu claimed, “In hate of Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family, @smritiirani and the BJP govt of Uttar Pradesh took lives of 121 people as the functioning of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital was stopped…” He later deleted his tweet.flesh alive passed the sell by date.The max sucking power of her throat and lungs it's all down hill from here,1.6 B Indian slaves being treated like animals.Shame on dirty Indian politics/politicians.Feku &Gang should be hanged, not worth living on planet earth.Sooner the betterOther propaganda artists also shared the claims about the death of 121 patients. On Friday (6th October) night, the District Magistrate & Collector of Amethi, Rakesh Kumar Mishra, rubbished the false claims being propagated on social media.एकदम भ्रामक एवं गलत बात कही जा रही है। किसी की मृत्यु नहीं हुई हैं। जनपद अमेठी के सभी सरकारी चिकित्सालयों में दवा आदि की कोई कमी नहीं है। तथ्य के विपरीत जनस्वास्थ्य के बारे में अफवाह फैलाने के विरूद्ध वैधानिक कार्यवाही की जाएगी ।“Completely misleading and wrong things are being shared. No one has died. There is no shortage of medicines in any government hospital of Amethi district,” he informed. “Legal action will be taken against spreading rumours about public health contrary to facts,” the District Magistrate of Amethi warned.Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. The victim went into a state of coma after being administered anaesthesia, prior to a kidney stone operation.Shukla was then referred to Medanta Hospital in Lucknow, where she eventually passed away. The district administration ordered the closure of the hospital, citing medical negligence, and directed the suspension of OPD and emergency services. A case was also registered against 4 employees of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital for negligence. On Wednesday (4th October), the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court put the order of the district administration on hold and directed the resumption of services.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The video which quickly went viral showed a person resembling cricket legend Kapil Dev, who had his hands tied and mouth strapped being manhandled and taken away by two goons. Cricketer turned politician Gautam Gambhir shared the clip on X, formally Twitter as he enquired about the World Cup-winning captain’s well-being. However, as soon as the video went viral, netizens started flooding Gautam Gambhir’s timeline hoping that it was a promotional stunt similar to what happened last year with cricket pundit Harsha Bhogle.Sharing the video Gautam Gambhir wrote, “Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev and that Kapil Paaji is fine!” along with a fingers-crossed emoji.Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev 🤞and that Kapil Paaji is fine! pic.twitter.com/KsIV33DbmpIn the 0.07-second clip, a man in a light blue t-shirt and checkered trousers is seen being carried away by two goons. The man, who resembles Kapil Dev, has his wrists tied behind him and his mouth strapped with a piece of cloth. The man turns around for a fraction of a second, revealing his face. He offers a helpless look as the two men drag him inside a dingy house.While no official statement has been issued regarding the viral video, numerous followers on social media have claimed that it is nothing more than a promotional gimmick. Advertisment lol😅😅No one falls for it nowMany Netizens reacted angrily, slamming the ad firm for the lame video and praying and hoping for the cricket legend’s well-being and safety. These ex cricketers are selling themselves for ad money. Some are selling gutkhas while others are doing these cheap ads. ShameSeeing Kapil Dev kidnapped in a viral clip is worrying every cricket fan. Hoping it's fictional, not real crime. If just an attention-grabbing ad, the creators should apologize for causing such distress irresponsibly.#KapilDev #ResponsibleMarketing https://t.co/WwmRLauk1pDisgusting way for viewership, atleast respect our legends 👍Some were quick to recall a video from last year that showed cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle abruptly disappearing while speaking to a sports portal via video link. Just as it was eventually revealed that Harsha Bhogle’s video was a promotional gimmick, many Netizens were convinced that this was a re-run of last year’s act.It looks like an ad.. Hopefully it is They did this earlier with Harsha too.A similar video that had left Netizens worrying, had emerged in March 2022, wherein cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle suddenly disappeared while talking to a sports portal via video link. Harsha Bhogle was talking to cricketsportwalkin on an Instagram live session on March 24, 2022, when suddenly he disappeared from the screen after the camera apparently fell to the ground with a blurry image. However, later it was revealed that it was a promotional stunt that went wrong, as people started genuinely worrying about him.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

13,"24 September, 2023 ",Fact Check: TMC leader Kirti Azad passes off old photo of BJP workers as ‘Sanghis protesting against Canada outside Canara Bank’," In October 2022, Kirti Azad shared a fake quote attributed to RSS leader MS Golwalkar on Twitter, which claimed that he was willing to tolerate British subjugation but not a government that granted Muslims and Dalits equal status.On Sunday (September 24), Trinamool Congress leader Kirti Azad courted controversy after he falsely claimed that BJP workers mistook Canara Bank for Canada and had been protesting outsides its premises.In a tweet (archive), the 64-year-old politician wrote, “BJP Sanghis assumed Canara Bank to be Canada and held demonstrations in front of the bank’s building.” The tweet was accompanied by a picture of a group of people, standing outside Canara Bank with BJP flags in hand.At the time of writing, the contentious tweet had more than 2000 likes and 500 retweets. The former cricketer-turned-politician sought to exploit the ongoing diplomatic tension between India and Canada to score political brownies.A quick ‘reverse Google image search’ of the image led us to a news report, published by Tamil daily ‘Maalai Malar’. The said report was published on August 30, 2020 i.e. 3 years ago.At the very onset, it became clear that the picture shared by Kirti Azad had nothing to do with the ongoing diplomatic standoff between India and Canada. The Maalai Malar report stated that BJP workers held demonstrations in Ooty against the city administration for removing a flagpole, which was installed to hoist the party flag. The municipality had alleged that no prior permission was sought from them by the BJP. Thus, it clearly shows that the BJP workers were not protesting against Canada in any form or manner. It is also interesting to note that the original picture was photoshopped with another image of Canara Bank by Kirti Azad to lend credence to his dubious claims.This is however not the first time that Kirti Azad has resorted to peddling fake news on social media. Earlier in February 2022, he falsely claimed that BJP leaders were being thrashed by the common people during the second phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh. In reality, the video is not from Uttar Pradesh but from the State of West Bengal. The victim in the incident was BJP leader Anirban Ganguly, who informed that he was attacked by Trinamool Congress-sponsored Jihadis. Hi Kirti, amusing to see that you,Bhagwat Jha Azad’s son,can’t distinguish between the hinterlands of #WestBengal & #UttarPradesh!This is clip of a jihadi attack engineered by TMC on me on Election Day, April 30 2021.Having become a FAMILY DOORMAT you have lost your rationality! https://t.co/qfkH1XGlV4In October 2022, Kirti Azad shared a fake quote attributed to RSS leader MS Golwalkar on Twitter, which claimed that he was willing to tolerate British subjugation but not a government in the nation that granted Muslims and Dalits equal status.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

14,"11 October, 2023 ","The New York Times publishes a report calling Hamas ‘terrorists’, changes to ‘gunmen’ after some time"," There is no mention in the NYT report that Hamas also fired over 5,000 rockets into Israel, many of which hit civilian areas after overwhelming Israel's air defence system Iron Dome.On Tuesday (10th October) The New York Times published a news regarding the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel. In this story, The New York Times called Hamas ‘terrorists’. However, it replaced the word ‘terrorists’ with ‘gunmen’ after some time, in line with the left-liberal media policy of not using the term terrorist for jihadi terrorists.The news article titled ‘Hamas Leaves Trail of Terror in Israel’ was published on 10th October by The New York Times. In the subtitle of the article, the American newspaper wrote, “As Israeli soldiers regain control of areas near Gaza that came under attack, they are finding evidence seen in videos and photos and confirmed by witness accounts of the massacre of civilians by Hamas terrorists.”After some time, The New York Times changed the last word in the sentence ‘terrorist’ to ‘gunmen’. The NYT was called out on social media for calling terrorists just gunmen in order to score Islamoapologetic secular credentials. American journalist Greg Price wrote, “Holy shit you can’t make this up. The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen”.” Greg Price also shared the screenshots of the news before and after the change.The archive of the report shows the term ‘terrorist’ used by NYT before it was replaced.🚨Holy shit you can’t make this up.The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen.” pic.twitter.com/zp7vQUrHn3Interestingly, while the original report used the term ‘terrorist’ in the subtitle, it was used only once in the report, while the word ‘gunmen’ was used throughout the report. The publication has not replaced the lone occurrence of the term terrorist in the report, which appears in the second paragraph. The word ‘gunmen’ appears 8 times in the report text, sometimes called ‘Palestinian gunmen’ or ‘Hamas gunmen’. There is no mention in the report that Hamas also fired over 5,000 rockets into Israel, many of which hit civilian areas after overwhelming Israel’s air defence system Iron Dome.Referring to the 9/11 terrorist attack in the USA, Greg Price also wrote, “Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.”Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.Another X user with handle ID @WithRitesh posted, “Learning from their brothers across Atlantic! This is Left Media!” In this post, he added a screenshot of a BBC news that called Hamas terrorists just ‘gunmen’.Learning from their brothers across Atlantic! This is Left Media! pic.twitter.com/SBduohHT95Syzmon Thomas posted, “Our media is contemptible and morally bankrupt. I am glad they are slowly, but surely, going the way of the newspaper.” He also added a screenshot of news by the Washington Post calling ISIS terrorist Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi an ‘austere religious scholar’. The words used for the ISIS terrorist were later changed to ‘extremist leader’ after the news outlet faced criticism.Our media is contemptible and morally bankrupt.

It has repeatedly provided a platform for Islamic bigotry. In April 2021, NYT published a news article that said that the onus to convert is on non-Muslims in case of an interfaith marriage involving a Muslim and a non-Muslim.The New York Times is also notorious for its anti-India anti-Modi agenda. In March 2023, the New York Times published an article written by Anuradha Bhasin, the Executive Editor of The Kashmir Times who criticized PM Modi’s stance against the Indian media and its freedom of expression. Donning an anti-India outlook on the international media platform, she alleged that the Modi-led government had imposed ‘repressive’ media policies in the country and was deliberately targeting the media organizations who chose to voice an opinion against it or the Prime Minister.The Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Youth Affairs, and Sports Anurag Thakur lashed out at the New York Times for this anti-India editorial published on 8th March 2023. Anurag Thakur had said, “We don’t need to learn the grammar of democracy from agenda-driven media.” Now, The New York Times has called the Hamas terrorists as gunmen. The recent Israel-Hamas war started after the State of Israel came under attack by Palestine-based Islamic terror outfit Hamas on Saturday (7th October), resulting in the death of more than 900 Israelis. About 2400 people have been wounded and over 100 still remain in the captivity of the terrorists. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

16,"10 October, 2023 ","Can Israel be a victim when all countries are supporting it: YouTuber Ravish Kumar downplays Hamas terror attack, floats conspiracy theory"," Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these Western nations doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”Two days after Hamas launched a terror attack on the State of Israel and killed 800 civilians in the process, Indian YouTuber Ravish Kumar on Monday (9th October) attempted to paint Hamas as the victim.“Whose terrorism should be condemned? Who is the terrorist in this case? There is another question – Who is the victim?”, he resorted to shielding the Palestine-based Islamist terror organisation Hamas.The former NDTV ‘journalist’ suggested that Israel could not be a victim of terror in the ongoing conflict as several powerful Western nations are supporting the Jewish State. Ravish shamelessly defends Hamas TerroristsAsks who is Real Terrorist- Hamas or Israel?Attacks countries supporting Israel of siding with Terrorists.""हमास और इज़राइल में किसके आतंकवाद की निंदा होनी चाहिए?”""बड़े देश शक्तिशाली इज़राइल का समर्थन कर आतंक का साथ दे रहे हैं” pic.twitter.com/F4bauFaBN8“We have seen an interesting nomenclature in several writings – one is being called a victim (aka Palestine) and another is dubbed as the victim of victims (aka Israel)… Both of them are accused of terrorism and both are victims…Powerful Israel, accused of occupation (in Gaza) is also a victim,” Ravish Kumar claimed. The former ‘scribe’ made a case for Hamas by claiming that the terror organisation in Palestine is not as ‘powerful’ as Israel. “Now imagine the flight of those who are weak (in front of Israel)…Most nations are with Israel and it is still the victim of ‘victims.’ Not even a handful of countries are with Palestine,” he brazened out.In a bid to pacify his large follower base of Hamas sympathisers, Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these countries doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”“एक महीना पहले, नेतन्याहू को जनता का समर्थन नहीं था।सवाल पूछा जाना चाहिए कि हमास अंदर कैसे आ गया, और इसका जवाब इज़राइल के जवाब में मिलेगा”रवीश घूमा-फिरा के बता रहे हैं कि हमला करवा कर नेतन्याहू अपनी सरकार बचा रहे।सिर्फ रवीश ऐसी घटिया सोच रख सकता। pic.twitter.com/1oWiFlBb0RLater in his monologue, the YouTuber insinuated that the Benjamin Netanyahu-led Israeli government orchestrated the attacks on its citizens for political mileage. “Even a month ago, Netanyahu did not have this level of popular support…Should we leave this question out as to how Hamas intruded into the border of Israel? I am sure the answer to this question…” he cast aspersions on Israel instead of questioning Hamas terrorists.Ravish Kumar made the contentious remarks during his 39-minute-long rant on his YouTube channel on Monday (9th October).Similar claims were earlier peddled by ‘journalist’ turned politician Prashant Kanojia, who alleged, “Elections in Israel are going to take place soon. The current Israeli Prime Minister is also a coward like the Prime Minister of another nation. He also wants to attack his own citizens and win elections.”This is not the first time that Ravish Kumar has resorted to whitewashing extremists, responsible for widespread violence. In August 2020, he tried to absolve the radical Islamists of their complicity in the Bengaluru riots.In his usual sober voice, which helps propaganda sound seamlessly soothing, Ravish claimed on Friday, “Jo dangai hota hai vo dangai hota hai. Na toh unha Hindu mazhab see koi matlab hota hai na hi koi Muslim mazhab see koi matlab hota hai (A rioter is a rioter. He has nothing to due with Hindusim or Islam.)”Ravish further claimed, “Rioters look for a reason to be provoked. Those who know this game plan are well acquainted with the fact that a post can attract mobs who will unleash.” Through his claims, Ravish tried to deny the ‘communal angle’ in the Bengaluru carnage. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

17,"9 October, 2023 ","Former Indian Express journalist Irena Akbar floats conspiracy theory, claims that deceased Shani Louk wore bikini and was not stripped by Hamas terrorists"," It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,"" the former Indian Express 'journalist' said.A day after Hamas terrorists stripped a German woman and paraded her dead body on a pickup truck, former Indian Express ‘journalist‘ Irena Akbar came out in defence of the terrorists on Sunday (8th October) morning.In a tweet, she wrote, “The woman, whose body was being taken in a pick-up truck, has been identified as Shani Louk, a German-Israeli dual citizen who was reportedly attending a music festival. First, this is NOT an etiquette of war in Islam to attack women, and hence this is condemnable.”The ex-scribe put out a token condemnation over the death of Louk only because ‘attacking women during war’ is supposedly against the tenets of Islam. Then, she proceeded to suggest that the victim was not stripped as she was not ‘fully naked.’One would have to suspend disbelief to believe what this woman is defending here. But, it is par for the course. Don’t underestimate the cruelty of the women of the barbaric cult. They are assigned various roles. One is the defence of a murder, the other is grooming in the… pic.twitter.com/ig50LljpwI“The woman is not fully naked, as parts of her upper & lower body are covered. If you check the Instagram account of Shani Louk (@shanukkk), you would see pictures she posted of herself wearing bikins or other skin-exposing outfits,” Irena Akbar brazened it out.She claimed that the victim could have been ‘partially naked’ at the time of her killing and not necessarily stripped by Hamas terrorists. “It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,” the former Indian Express ‘journalist’ said.“…I am being factual here, based on evidence from her own Instagram account where she would post pictures of herself in such clothes. So, it cannot be ruled out that Shani (with all due respect to her) was wearing a bikini or other similar garment when she was killed or captured,” she further alleged.Irena Akbar wrote, “And hence, it is possible that she was NOT stripped by the Hamas militants. However, as Islam prescribes modesty for women and men, and respect for the dead, the militants should have covered her body with a cloth or sheet, and treated it respectfully, or not attack her at all.”She then resorted to mental gymnastics and asked why people, who hail bikinis as a symbol of ‘freedom’, are raising concerns about seeing a woman’s uncovered body. The ex- Indian Express ‘journalist’ conveniently glossed over the fact that the victim was murdered, stripped and paraded by Hamas terrorists.“So, let’s be fair before jumping to outrage, or celebration. Also, I have a question for non- Muslims: You often share pictures of bikini- clad Iranian women on beaches before the Islamic Revolution of 1979. You lament that the women were “free and liberated” in Iran before Shariah law was adopted,” Akbar remarked.“You use the bikini as a symbol of freedom and liberation for Muslim women of Iran, and you contrast that with the hijab, a symbol of “oppression” under Iran’s mandatory hijab law. So, why do you have a problem when Shani Louk was possibly wearing a bikini (when she was sadly captured)?” she brazened out.“Why do you have a problem when her almost-naked body could be publicly seen? Are you again using a woman’s uncovered body to make a point against Palestinians, and Muslims?” the former ‘scribe’ concluded.In April 2021, Irena Akbar stirred the hornet’s nest by thanking Allah for the Coronavirus pandemic. She claimed “If it weren’t for Covid, Indian Muslims would’ve been in detention camps. I’m NOT being grateful for the virus which killed my aunt, sent my dad to the ICU & is causing tragedies across homes. I’m stressing the fact that while fascists were making their plans, God was making His.”“It’s between the devil & the deep blue sea for IMs. Either die/live in fear of Covid OR die/live in fear of anti-Muslim state violence. At least the former doesn’t specifically target us & the public will eventually question the state. But in latter, the public would rejoice it,” she added.In February 2020, she asserted that Dalits should never be trusted by the Muslim community. The Islamist claimed that the Dalits were the ‘foot soldiers’ when communal riots broke out in Gujarat in 2002 after a Muslim mob engineered the Godhra train carnage.“They did the dirty job of gang-raping and killing Muslims. I have never trusted them. They are ill-treated by their upper-caste Hindu brothers, not by Muslims. We owe them nothing,” she wrote. Irena Akbar also called for boycotts of business establishments run by Hindus. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

20,"4 October, 2023 ","Uttar Pradesh: Farmer reaches police station to file FIR against goats in Kanpur, accuses them of stealing flowers"," In a bizarre turn of events, a man in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur reached a police station to file complaint against goats for stealing his flowers. A bizarre case has come to light in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur where a person named Shailendra Nishad reached a police station with a complaint against goats for stealing flowers. According to him, some goats entered his field and started eating the marigold blooms. He was able to catch two of them from the spot which he then put in an auto and drove to the cops. This has created a peculiar situation for the authorities who are now in an odd predicament and unsure of what course of action to take.The strange incident which transpired in the Gauri Kakra village of the Bhitargaon block has turned into a topic of discussion in the neighbourhood. Flowers are cultivated around here and the complainant who is a farmer by profession is also into Floriculture. He had been worried for quite some time because someone would secretly pluck them in the evening. He asked the people of his hamlet regarding the same but could not find any information. On 2nd October, he decided against going to the city to sell the flowers and sat down with a stick to guard his fields. Meanwhile, in the evening he discovered that four to five goats had invaded his land from one side and devoured the flowers. He became outraged and tried to capture the four-legged thieves. However, he was able to nab only two of them after which he went straight to the road, loaded them into the vehicle and arrived at the police station. The policemen were astounded to witness the man with the goats and shocked to learn the reason behind his visit. When the cops inquired about the purpose of bringing the livestock there, he responded, “Sir, they quietly gorge on my flowers every day due to which I am suffering a lot of financial loss. However, the owner of the goats does not pay any attention to them. Therefore, I caught these goats which steal and eat my flowers and brought them here.”The cops were perplexed about what to do after hearing his story, however, they later found out who the animals belonged to. Police Inspector Pramod Kumar informed that they are of a girl in the village. Someone had loosed them and they went into the fields, but now instruction has been given to keep them tied. Authorities have also warned that the animals should not enter the victim’s fields again. The matter was resolved and he has forgiven the goat owner and no First Information Report was submitted either. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

21,"4 October, 2023 ",Anandotsav: How a new Bharatanatyam festival in Mumbai gave a sneak peek into the future of one of India’s ancient dance forms," To be able to resonate with the common man, even when they may or may not understand the intricacies of an ancient dance and art form like Bharatanatyam, is an achievement in itself. On a drizzly Saturday evening (30 September), when the maximum city generally turns into one big ball of blinding disco lights, the new seeds of Bharat’s ancient art and culture were sprouting in one of the suburbs of Mumbai. Chimes of ghungroos echoing with every taalam (rhythm) reverberated through the alleys of Vile Parle.“Aanandotsav”, the first annual Bharatanatyam festival organised by Kalaadnya Dance Academy in partnership with Nrityankur, marked the arrival of a new generation of Bharatanatyam performers. Both Kalaadnya and Nrityankur are affiliated with the Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya till Alankar Poorna (the final stage of Bharatanatyam training). Kalaadnya was founded in 2016 by Sayali Sutar, a Girnar Ratna awardee and Master in Bharatanatyam, who has performed across cities in and outside India. Sayali Sutar is a disciple of the great Vaibhav Arekar, founder of Sankhya Dance Company.The 163-seater auditorium of Sathye College was fully occupied by guests, friends and families of Devis, most of whom were delivering their debut performance. Gracing the occasion amongst the guests were Gautam Marathe, ace Bharatanatyam dancer and founder of Angika, and Pooja Pant, ace Kathak dancer and founder of Pooja Pant Dance Company.The show began with three young girls presenting their first piece called Todaimangalam, an invocation piece in praise of Shri Ganesha. The young performers were still just tracing their steps from the training but attempted to put their best foot forward aspiring to give a physical form to the Shlokas dedicated to Gajanana, Maa Saraswati, Mahalakshmi, and Bhagwan Shiva.The nervousness in the budding talent was evident even as their beautiful red costumes and vibrant shringar (make-up) enthralled the audience. This was the first time that many among the audience were witnessing their daughters perform Bharatanatyam, which many pursue as nothing more than an extra-curricular activity or a hobby but only a rare jewel makes it to the global stage.The show took the spectators through the journey of Bharatanatyam training. How yogic steps including sukshma vyayam (light exercises) are practised by Bharatanatyam dancers for muscle strengthening and toning to get the perfect posture were expressed with a tinge of humour in the performance called Natyobics.From hereon began the introduction to Bharatanatyam through Bharatanatyam. The youngest to the eldest dancers of Kalaadnya performed a piece called Adavumala, meaning a chain of basic movements of Bharatanatyam, choreographed by Sayali Sutar. The performance was followed by another piece called Alarippu, a flowering bud, which aptly describes the performers themselves.Vatsalya Padam, performed to the melodious bhajan ‘Krishna Ne Begane Baaro’ in Kannada language in Ragam Yamuna Kalyani and Talam Mishra Chapu, showed how Maa Yashoda is enchanted by the divinity of playing hide and seek with her son, Krishna, The Jagadguru. The blissful and wholesome choreography is credited to Vaibhav Arekar. It was performed by Kalaadnya student Mrunmayi Malpekar.The show then dives deeper into Bhakti, a state of divine trance if you will, with group performances to Achyutam Keshavam – a Hindi bhajan translated from the original Sanskrit rendition by Shri Adi Shankaracharya; Shri Ram Stuti, written by the supreme devotee of Bhagwan Ram, Goswami Tulsidas and choreographed by Sayali; and Kasturi Tilakam. Special mention goes to the sole boy dancer amongst a large group of girl dancers, like Krishna among Gopis.The Mallari performance was like a grand Ganesh Chaturthi celebration taking centre stage. It added a fun twist to this journey of performances dedicated to Devis and Devatas. The rendition conveyed India’s vibrant and magnificent religious processions when a temple deity is carried by an ocean of devotees out of His and Her humble abode on special occasions. Performed in Raga Nattai, Tala Aadi, this piece – performed by the terrific trio Srishti Ganesh, Pritha Bakshi, and Mrunmayi Malpekar – through Bharatanatyam, beautifully packaged the colours and excitement that Hindu religious processions bring to society.What came next was the show-stopper of the evening. From the music to the Bhakti in the performances listed above, there was a sense of familiarity. But the most intense aspect of Bharatanatyam revealed itself when Kalaadnya’s Srishti Ganesh performed Javali, a light classical love song with strokes of romantic gestures, something that the layman is used to witnessing only in movies most times. Such renditions are not easy to guage and understand unless the performer has used their expressions and mannerisms with precision. Srishti Ganesh achieved that beautifully. When she entered the stage, Srishti seemed to be on the backfoot owing to her light make-up, but from the very first to the last movement of her performance, Srishti had captured the attention of the spectators in its entirety. Her poetic mannerisms and the effortless ease with which she expressed a woman in love, being teased by and getting lost in the thoughts of her lover would make anyone want to fall in love.The order of the performances designed by the organisers deserves appreciation. The Jatiswaram performance, a purely Bharatanatyam recital sans abhinay, ensured that the flow of the show remained undisturbed as did the sentiments evoked by the previous performances.Instead of bringing the evening to a close, the festival concluded by welcoming Navratri and paying obeisance to Mahishasur Mardini and the ever-existing and all-knowing forms of Maha Shakti. The best part was the battle between Maa Durga and demon Mahishasur followed by the various forms of Devi Shakti.To be able to resonate with the common man, even when they may or may not understand the intricacies of an ancient dance and art form like Bharatanatyam, is an achievement in itself. That Kalaadnya’s Sayali and Nrityankur’s Arundhati through Anandotsav have taken it upon themselves to realise the aspirations of young and bright Bharatanatyam performers assures that the best of Indian culture is nowhere nearly lost and there’s surely more to come.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

22,"27 September, 2023 ",When a Hindu King did a ‘Sardar Patel’ 575 years ago: How Gajapati Kapilendra Deva from Odisha liberated Telangana from Islamic rule," Under the leadership of Kapilendra Deva of the Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty, a dynamic and forward-thinking ruler emerged. Unlike many of his contemporaries who adopted a defensive posture against Islamic kingdoms, Kapilendra Deva believed in taking the battle to enemy territories, and ultimately defeat the tyrant Sanjar Khan in modern-day Telangana region. A few days ago, we commemorated the Hyderabad Liberation Day, paying homage to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s strategic genius, which promptly put an end to the oppression of the Razakars under the Nizams, sparing the Hindu majority from further suffering. The well-coordinated and decisive action by the Indian Army dealt a crippling blow to the barbaric Razakars, who had subjected Hyderabad’s Hindus to unspeakable cruelty. This marked the realization of a long-cherished dream for the people of the region — freedom from the Nizam’s rule.Surprisingly, a strikingly similar historical parallel unfolded in the very same region nearly 575 years ago. During the reign of the formidable Bahmani Sultanate, ruled by Allaudin Ahmad Shah, almost the entire expanse of Telangana came under his dominion by 1448 CE. This conquest followed the expulsion of local Hindu chiefs who had held sway in the region for years.With most of Telangana under his control, Ahmad Shah appointed Sanjar Khan as the region’s governor. Khan proved to be a ruthless despot harbouring a profound hatred for the local Hindu population. He captured Hindus and forced them into servitude(Mukherjee Prabhat, The history of the Gajapati kings of Orissa, p.29), with women and children bearing the brunt of his brutality mostly. Throughout his rule, Hindus lived in perpetual fear of enslavement.Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Odisha, significant developments were underway. Under the leadership of Kapilendra Deva of the Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty, a dynamic and forward-thinking ruler emerged. Unlike many of his contemporaries who adopted a defensive posture against Islamic kingdoms, Kapilendra Deva believed in taking the battle to enemy territories. Starting with a relatively modest domain comprising 5-6 districts surrounding his capital, Cuttack, in Odisha, he expanded his realm all the way to the Krishna River in modern-day Andhra Pradesh by 1448 CE. Along the way, he decisively defeated the Sultanate of Bengal and Malwa, annexing their territories.With his dominion bordering that of Bahmanis he was not unaware of what was happening in Telengana. Therefore, the clash with the Bahmanis was just a matter of time. Sultan Ahmad Shah was well aware of the formidable Gajapati army’s military might, often reputed to include an astounding 2 lakh elephants (Mohapatra R P, Military history of Orissa, p. 122). While this might seem like an exaggeration, the Odia army indeed boasted a considerable number of elephants, which earned their kings the moniker “Gajapatis.” Nevertheless, the Sultan advised the stubborn Sanjar Khan to avoid tangling with the “possessors of elephants,”(Indian Antiquary Vol. XXVIII P. 237) recognizing that he was no match for them. This counsel fell on deaf ears, and haughty Sanjar Khan engaged the Gajapati army in battle. The Gajapati army was well prepared and had eagerly awaited this opportunity to strike at the Bahmanis. The stage for a fierce confrontation was set in modern-day Khammam, Telangana. Leading this pivotal battle was Hamvira Deva, Kapilendra’s son, and it ultimately led to the slaying of the tyrant Sanjar Khan (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.49). Finally, the Hindus of the region could breathe a sigh of relief.This marked the beginning of a series of invasions by Kapilendra into the Bahmani Sultanate’s territory. He not only liberated the entire Telangana region from the Bahmanis but also captured Mahur Fort, located in the modern-day Nanded district, Maharashtra from them. Other important forts like Racakonda, Devarkonda, Warangal (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.54) and many more fell into his hand. Ultimately, the Gajapati army laid siege to Bidar, the capital of the Bahmani kingdom in modern Karnataka. Sanjar Khan’s brutal reign was met with a resolute response from the Hindu conqueror Kapilendra Deva, culminating in the capture of the Bahmani capital (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.58). This historical episode bears an uncanny resemblance to the events in newly independent India. In the same region, the Razakars perpetrated heinous atrocities against the Hindu populace, and we witnessed how Sardar Patel’s brilliance ensured their demise.Such historical events underscore the importance of leaders with a profound understanding of prevailing geopolitical circumstances and an unwavering commitment to Hindu interests. However, it is essential to remember that such responses require meticulous long-term planning and years of preparation. Our history stands as a testament to our ability to execute such strategies successfully, both in the past and potentially in the future. Unfortunately, the significant achievements of this great king who at one point ruled along the east coast from the Hooghly River of West Bengal in the north to Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu in the south, have not been much explored by earlier scholars due to various reasons. This author has tried to put those in the form of a book titled “Gajapati Kapilendra Deva, The history of the greatest Hindu conqueror of 15th Century India”.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

23,"11 October, 2023 ","Maharashtra: Gaurakshaks in Pune save cows, Iqbal Alam and two other smugglers arrested; cow meat seized from a vehicle in Manchar"," During interrogation, Rahim Shaikh said that the cows were brought from Sanjay Pawar who lives in Pandit Jawahar Lal Colony at Canal Road behind Dasbhuja Ganapati Mandir on Karve Road in Pune. On Tuesday (10th October) Gorakshaks in Pune saved two cows from the clutches of cow smugglers who were taking the cows to a slaughterhouse in Pune. Iqbal Alam and other two smugglers were arrested in this case based on the complaint filed by Gorakshak Upendra Balkavde. In another incident in the Pune district, cow meat was seized from a car in Manchar on 9th October.Upendra Mahadev Balkawade, 32, works with the Hyundai Company in Pune. He has also been working as the Pune district president of the All India Krishi Go Seva Sangh for the last two years. Upendra Balkavde said in his complaint, “On 09/10/2023, around 09:30 pm, I received a call from my Gaurakshak colleague. He told me that two cows were being taken to Kondhwa Pune for slaughter in Motor Tempo Vehicle No. MH 12 QW 5747 from Rajaram Bridge Pune. Accordingly, my Gaurakshak colleagues Suraj Suresh Bandal, Ganesh Dattatray Sutar, Manish Mahadev Chavan and I sat in a motor car No. MH 12 OT 1400 at Dandekar Bridge and stopped on the road leading to Swargate.”He further stated, “On 09/10/2023 at around 11:45 pm, we saw the motor tempo heading towards Saaras Bagh and immediately we followed him in our car. We warned the tempo driver to stop. But the driver did not stop his vehicle and went ahead from Savarkar Chowk, Mitra Mandal Chowk. Laxmi Narayan Chowk, and Diasplot Chowk.”Upendra Balkavde added in his complaint, “Since the driver was not stopping his tempo, I stopped my car in front of his vehicle at Golden Bakery Diasplot Gultekdi Pune around 00:05 pm. We all got out of our car and inspected the tempo. The rear of the tempo was covered with green tarpaulin sheets. When the tarpaulin sheet was removed, we discovered two live cows, one white and one black-and-white. I called the police control room and called the police to the spot. When the police arrived, the police and I took the tempo and came to Swargate police station, Pune.”The three arrested accused are identified as Iqbal Alam (age 22, resident of Ghorpadi village in Pune), Rahim Ismail Shaikh (age 32), and Deepak Lallan Singh Thakur (age 30). During interrogation, Rahim Shaikh said that the cows were brought from Sanjay Pawar who lives in Pandit Jawahar Lal Colony at Canal Road behind Dasbhuja Ganapati Mandir on Karve Road in Pune. A case in this regard is registered in Swargate police station under sections 5 and 9(A) of the Maharashtra Animal Protection Act 1976, and sections 11(1)D, 11(1)E, and 11(1)I of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The Gaurakshaks and police took the cows to a local Jain Hindu Gaushala in Pune.A copy of this FIR is with OpIndia. OpIndia contacted Upendra Balkavde to learn more about the incident. He said, “We Gaurakshaks have an active network in and around Pune city. The accused in this case are arrested by police and will face legal consequences. We do our best using whatever capacities we have. The smugglers were taking the cows to Kondhwa. The Kondhwa area in Pune has become a hiding hub of Islamic terrorists. Recently, the NIA took action and nabbed a few such people who used to live there. Slaughterhouses are also in the same Kondhwa area.”Upendra Balkavde added, “Sanjay Pawar mentioned in this case supplies cows to these smugglers. We have caught him in two similar cases before this incident. He is a repeat offender. Most of the cow smugglers take cows to the Mumbai area. However, in and around Pune city, our group works hard to prevent cow slaughter and save Gaumata and Dharma.”Underlining the importance of coordinated efforts of all the Gaurakshaks, Upendra Balkavde said, “No mission is difficult when the community comes together to put a joint effort. Ours is not a very large group, but coordinated work gives effective output. In this operation, Sahil Pawar, Ganesh Sutar, Manish Chavan, Chetan Badole, Datta Pawar, Tanmay Babar, Sahil Kamble, Aniket Dalvi, Sachin Gaikwad, Suraj Bandal, Siddhesh Shigwan, and Shivam Sonawane played a crucial role. They were with me throughout the incident and took various responsibilities in this task to save the cows.”The incident came to light in the early hours of 9th October when beef weighing 405 kg was found in a four-wheeler that met with an accident on Pune Nashik Highway Road at Bhorwadi under Manchar police station limits. A case has been registered against the unidentified absconding driver and unidentified owner of the car. At approximately 3:50 am on 9th October, an unknown individual, driving a Ritz car with the registration MH06AZ7781, was travelling at a high speed on the Pune-Nashik Highway. This vehicle collided with the pickup truck, bearing the license plate MH14KQ7339, which was owned by Akshay Shankar Thorat, a resident of Manchar Pimpalgaon in the Ambegaon taluka, from behind.Partially cut organs and flesh of cattle weighing 405 kg worth Rs 81,000 were found in the car. The driver of the car escaped from the spot. A case has been registered against the driver and owner of the car under sections 279 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code, sections 184,134 (A)( B), and 177 of the Motor Vehicle Act, Sections 5, 5(c), and 9(a) of Maharashtra Animal Protection Amendment Act 1995, and section 11 of Indian Animal Protection Act.Police Sub-Inspector Shete is conducting a further investigation into this case under the supervision of Police Inspector Balwant Mandge. It is notable that Balwant Mandge is the same police officer who upheld the peace talks and restrained people from filing any case in a recent incident of a Hindu-Muslim scuffle during the Ganpati Visarjan procession in Manchar. A day after this incident, Islamists in Manchar attacked the house of a Bajrang Dal activist Suraj Chakradhar Dharam. When the members of Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad insisted that a case should be filed in this regard, the attackers apologised to Suraj Dharam and his family members with folded hands.

24,"9 October, 2023 ","Blood, Islam, and oil: The Saud family’s history of bloody battles with Ottomans, desert warlords, and partnership with the USA to become a global power"," After conquering Hejaz in 1925, Al Saud officially incorporated the title 'King of Najd and Hejaz'. In 1932, the two merged together to give birth to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - named after Abdulaziz’s family (Al Saud).On 9th September 2023, a groundbreaking agreement was unveiled during the G20 Summit in New Delhi with the announcement of a rail and shipping corridor from India to Europe via the Middle East. The project – ‘India-Middle East-Europe Shipping and Railway Connectivity Corridor’ (IMEE EC) is being hailed as the new spice route in the new world order. As part of the IMEE EC project, ‘moderate’ Saudi Arabia and ‘Jewish-majority’ Israel have come closer than ever to normalise their diplomatic ties. Reportedly, Saudi Arabia is engaged in negotiations with the United States to sign a defense pact in exchange for establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, a nation that was considered a pariah in the Islamic world. However, reports suggest that Saudi Arabia will not obstruct a deal even if Israel does not grant significant concessions to the Palestinians in their quest for statehood. Apparently, these changing geopolitical happenings are being attributed as one of the motives behind the recent terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel. Although the Hamas-initiated attacks could derail or delay the deal, back-channel diplomacy continues to bridge gaps and bring the Saudi-US deal closer to finalisation. Against this backdrop, the Middle Eastern region is potentially at the cusp of marking an end to the dominance of Wahhabi ideology which was deeply rooted in a puritanical interpretation of Islam, in the Middle East and its spheres of influence.  Remarkably, the Wahhabi ideology has exerted its dominance and molded the course of events across the Middle East for the better part of three centuries. It also played a pivotal role in the formation of the modern Middle East, notably Saudi Arabia as it stands today, and the consolidation of power by the Al Saud, the ruling monarchy of Saudi Arabia. The power dynamics in the region are an outcome of alliances both matrimonial (blood pact), religious pacts, and regional partnerships that were born out of inter-imperial battles between the Ottoman and British Empires.    In the 18th century, Muhammad ibn Saud from the Al Saud (Al being referred to as family) was a Chieftan of a small oasis town of Diriyah on the outskirts of modern-day Riyadh. During his reign, an Islamic fundamentalist theologian, Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab sought refuge in Diriyah as he was thrown out of Hejaz, the region that housed both the holy sites of Islam – Mecca and Medina. Wahhab’s extremist interpretation of Islam had irked the Hashmites who had been Sharifs of these holy sites for several centuries. These Sharifs who hailed from the Hashmites tribe of Hejaz owed allegiance to the Ottoman Empire. The Islamic Empire had limited or nominal direct interest in the affairs of the Middle Eastern region primarily because of the lack of resources in the Middle East in general, the Najd region in particular, and its unfavorable desert climate. However, it maintained a significant interest in the religious pilgrimage routes and at the holy sites of Islam.Meanwhile, Chieftan Mohd ibn Saud not only gave refuge to Wahhab but also signed a pact with him in 1744 marking the beginning of the First Saudi state. Under the pact which is often dubbed as “Wahhabi-Saudi Pact”, Mohd ibn Saud remained as the Emir while Wahhab assumed the title of ‘Imam’. To strengthen the pact, Ibn Saud’s eldest son married al-Wahhab’s daughter. Al Saud publicly embraced Wahhabism. As a theologian, Wahhab also went on to lay the foundation of “Wahhabism” in the region. The aim of this pact was to bring purity to the faith and establish a puritanical form of Islam. Soon, Wahhabism became the official Saudi religious doctrine. Under this extreme form, religious innovation (bidaa) was vehemently rejected and it advocated for eliminating practices such as Sufi rites and veneration of saints. During their conquest outside Najd, they destroyed shrines of the Shia minority. The Wahabis used the slur ‘Rafida’ (rejecters) to refer to Shia, which still continues in the 21st century. On the other hand, the Emir of Diryiah Mohd ibn Saud started expanding control over various tribal regions in Najd (the central part of current-day Saudi Arabia) and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. He had gained religious certification from Imam Abdul Wahhab. Subsequently, brainwashed ‘Wahhabist’ tribes like Ikhwan joined his religious conquest of the Arabian Peninsula, under the Al Saud banner.The Emir also formed alliances with tribal leaders and groups in Najd, including the Ajman and Otaiba tribes. These alliances were mostly based on a mix of military cooperation and shared religious ideals, particularly Wahhabi Islam.However, the battle of consolidation included fierce battles against the rival Al Rashid (Rashidi family) and the Hashemite Sharif of Mecca, who had support from Egypt, the vassalage of the Ottoman Empire. In 1765, the Emir of Diriyah, Muhammad bin Saud passed away but by then the Wahhabis had controlled Najd and expanded in all directions, including Mecca and Medina. He was succeeded by his son Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud Al Saud as the new Emir of Diriyah.The period between 1811-1818 saw battles which are also known as the Egyptian-Wahhabi War as it was fought by the Egyptian representative of Ottoman and Wahhabists from Diriyah under the Al Saud banner. During the religiously zealous conquest, when the Egyptian subjects of Ottomans attempted to invade al-Hasa’ which lies in eastern Arabia, the Wahhabis seized the holy city of Karbala’ in Turkish Iraq (1801). It was followed by capturing Mecca itself in 1802. By the year 1805, the Wahhabis controlled Mecca and Medina. They had also attacked Karbala and the Imam Husayn Shrine which directly challenged the Ottoman Empire and their vassalage, Egyptians and Hashmite Sharifs of Mecca. Furthermore, under the leadership of Emir Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud, the Wahhabis targeted Ottoman trade routes, badly impacting the finances of the Ottoman Empire. The Emir of Diryiah also openly denounced and questioned the Ottoman Sultan Mustafa IV, challenging his legitimacy as the Caliph and protectorate of the faithful and holy sites in Hejaz.Following that, in 1811, the Ottoman Sultan Mahmoud II ordered Muhammad Ali Pasha, who was considered the Wāli in Egypt, to check the expansionist spree of the Emir of Diryiah. Ali then assigned his son, Tusun Pasha, to lead a force of 10,000 soldiers. However, in 1812, the Emir of Diriyah, Abdullah defeated Tusun Pasha at Al-Safra. But with a reinforcement of 10,000 men, Pasha recaptured Mecca and Medina. On account of poor health, Tusun tried to forge a treaty with the Emir in which Hejaz was to be surrendered & vassalage offered. However, neither Ali nor the Sultan ratified the treaty with the House of Saud. In 1816 Tusun Pasha died and with mutual distrust abound, the war resumed with Ali’s other son, Ibrahim Pasha assumed leadership and led an expedition, driving the Saudi Emir and his “Wahhabis” (more properly Salafis) into the desert of Najd.Subsequently, in 1818 Ibrahim marched across the desert and brought his forces to the gates of Diriyah. They ruthlessly massacred the male population of the rebel force. Diriyah was razed to the ground and all Wahhabi theologians found were executed. The captured Emir of Diriyah Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud was brought to Istanbul where he was publicly beheaded and his head was thrown into the Bosphorus. Additionally, the Wahhabis were compelled to listen to music, an act strictly prohibited in Wahhabism.This marked the ending of the first Saudi state (1744-1818) which had begun with the Saudi-Wahhabi pact. Two years after causing disruption in Najd, Ottoman forces withdrew from the region. Over the ensuing eighty years, the Al Saud made several attempts to regain control of the Arabian Peninsula, but their efforts failed courtesy of the Ottoman-Al Rashidi alliance. Son of Former Emir of Diriyah, Turki bin Abdullah bin Muhammad Al Saud and a few others had managed to escape the Ottoman carnage and soon after the Ottoman’s withdrawal, they started to regain their lost territories.  By 1824, the Al-Saud family had regained political control of central Arabia. With Diryiah in ruins, the Saudi ruler Turki bin Abdullah Al-Saud transferred his capital to Riyadh which was some 20 miles south of Diriyah. With this, he established the Second Saudi State. In his 11 years of reign, Turki recaptured most of the lands lost to the Ottoman Empire. The Second Saudi State, under the leadership of Turki and his son Faisal, came to an end when the Al-Rashid family of Hail, with the backing of the Ottomans, successfully overthrew the Saudi State. This occurred during the Ottoman Empire’s renewed campaign in 1865 to expand its influence in the Middle East. Ottoman armies had captured parts of the Saudi State, which was ruled at the time by Faisal’s son, Abdulrahman. After repeated defeats by a much larger and better-equipped army, Abdulrahman bin Faisal Al-Saud abandoned the struggle in 1891 marking the end of the Second Saudi state. During the exile, he sought refuge with the Bedouin tribes in the vast sand desert of eastern Arabia known as the Rub’ Al-Khali, or ‘Empty Quarter.’ From there, Abdulrahman and his family traveled to Kuwait, where they stayed until 1902. His young son Abdulaziz became the head of secular and military matters while he was in exile. Over the course of time, he launched raids and terrorised the tribes loyal to the Al Rashidis with an aim to regain Al Saud territories from Rashidis, the vassalage of Ottomans. On 15th January 1902, Abdulaziz, a direct descendent of Muhammad ibn Saud, accompanied by only 40 followers – mostly his blood relatives, half-brothers, cousins, and Kingsmen launched a daring night mission. They scaled the walls of Riyadh’s citadel to capture the city garrison, known as the Masmak Fortress. The Rashidi governor and his loyal man were slaughtered in cold blood. Reviving the emirate of Najd, with Abdulaziz as Emir and Abdul Rahman as Imam, this raid marked the beginning of the establishment of the third Saudi estate which continues to this present day and is known as the modern Saudi state.Meanwhile, during World War 1 (1914-1919), the Al Saud aligned with the British Empire against their common foe, the Ottoman Turks, and their Arabian allies. He signed the Treaty of Darin with the British in 1915 which recognised his authority over much of Najd and established a formal alliance.Around the same time, Britishers lured Hejaz into its own orbit and pulled it away from the Ottomans which later proved to be a great betrayal for the Hashimites. Evidently, during the ‘Arab Revolt’ (1916-1918), the Hejaz area (Mecca and Medina) broke free from the Ottomans. This was led by Shareef Hussein, the founder of the Hashemite dynasty and he declared himself king of the Arab countries as well as later, the new Caliph. However, in reality, he was only the king of Hejaz. Hussein was originally the Sharif of Mecca. In the present-day context, the descendants of Hashemite dynasties are now the monarchs of Jordan. Notably, the British and French had an agreement called the Sykes-Picot Agreement to divide some territories of the Middle East. Palestine, Jordan, and Iraq were actually controlled by the British. At the same time, Syria was controlled by the French. After capturing Riyadh, Al Saud wanted to expand further and consolidate the tribal areas once and for all. Apart from allying with Britishers, Abdulaziz also allied with the fierce nomadic warrior tribe of Bedouins, Ikhwan, or Muslim brothers. The Ikhwan had been brainwashed in Wahhabi ideology during the reign of Abdulaziz’s forefathers. Together they crushed all rebels including Ottoman’s effort to intervene. They captured Mecca in 1924 and Medina in 1925 which were ruled by Hashimites who had been pulled away from Ottomans by the British, yet British ally Al Saud ended 700 years of rule of Hashmities as Sharif of the Holy cities of Islam (barring a few years in between).   Consequently, Abdulaziz became the ruler of the Two Holy Cities of Islam. However, afterward, Al Saud crushed Ikhwan in 1929, their Muslim warriors as they had an uncontrollable urge to spread Wahhabism beyond Arabia despite Abd al-Aziz imposing restrictions on them. The Ikhwan had started considering them corrupt due to their enormous wealth and Western allies. After conquering Hejaz in 1925, Al Saud officially incorporated the title ‘King of Najd and Hejaz’. In 1932, the two merged together to give birth to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – named after Abdulaziz’s family (Al Saud).In order to forge unity in his newly established kingdom, Abd al-Aziz entered into marital alliances by marrying daughters from every powerful tribe in the region and influential clerical families, he had around twenty wives, however, not more than four wives at a time, in accordance with Quranic principles. With these unions, he had 45 legitimate sons and an undisclosed number of daughters (with daughters typically not being counted). His half-brothers and cousins assisted him in conquering the peninsula. However, he started consolidating power in favor of his own sons. Since then, every Saudi king has been a son of Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman aka MBS is his only grandson who has risen to power. Despite having an alliance with the British, Saudi Arabia was wary of its imperial ambitions, and moving forward it found an ally in the United States. Consequently, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. established diplomatic relations. Subsequently, in 1933, the initial foreign oil explorers made their way to the kingdom. The Americans, in a significant transaction, paid $170,000 in gold for land concessions that, as it turned out, held the world’s largest oil reserves. Despite facing criticism that the invitation of foreigners into the kingdom contradicted Islamic principles and citing precedent from the Quran, King Abd al-Aziz extended an invitation to U.S. oil companies to help develop Saudi Arabia’s oil resources. Collaboratively, the oil companies and the Saudi government established a joint venture, which later evolved into the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), with shareholders that included America’s four largest oil corporations.While the kingdom maintained a stance of neutrality during World War II, it leaned towards the Allies. Towards the war’s conclusion, King Abd al-Aziz held meetings with both UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). In 1945, despite health concerns for both leaders, King Abd al-Aziz and FDR met for three days aboard the U.S.S. Quincy, which was docked in the Suez Canal. The Quincy Agreement laid the groundwork for Saudi-American cooperation in matters related to oil and defense. Additionally, the two leaders solidified a confidential pact: King Abd al-Aziz pledged to grant the US secure access to Saudi oil, while in return, the US committed to providing military assistance, training, and the construction of the Dhahran military base in Saudi Arabia.Since then, barring a few instances of power struggles within the Royal family, the House of Saud has been a stable power in the Middle East and the country leading the oil powers in the region. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

25,"9 October, 2023 ","As Hamas attack on Israel triggers a war in Middle East, here is all you need to know about Hamas and the Gaza Strip"," Hamas is a designated terrorist entity and for this reason, it is barred from getting
official assistance that the United States and European Union (EU) provide to the PLO in the West Bank.On 7th October (Saturday), Israel came under one of the worst attacks in recent history after dozens of Hamas terrorists infiltrated the Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip. Additionally, Palestinian terrorists also launched massive rocket barrages at southern and central Israel from the Gaza Strip prompting it to declare a ‘state of war’. The terrorists also held several Israelis hostage including women, children, and the elderly. They have killed several civilians in indiscriminate firing and videos of the incident doing rounds on the internet reveal that they had also paraded women bared and bruised on the streets of Israeli towns.Following the terrorist attack on Israel, Palestinian Islamic Movement, Hamas claimed responsibility for these attacks. In a rare public statement, the leader of the military wing of Hamas, Mohammed Deif announced that it has launched a new military operation against Israel. Mohammed Deif added that 5,000 rockets had been fired into Israel early Saturday to begin “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm” and provoked all Palestinians to fight. It is important to note that Deif’s provocation was delivered in a recording as he has been in hiding after surviving multiple assassination attempts.On its part, Israeli forces have started retaliation and are fighting to regain control of areas captured by the Hamas terrorists. Amidst this, here is a brief overview of everything about this outfit1 Hamas, including its genesis, its supporters, and how it draws funds to attack Israel. Hamas is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, which means “Islamic Resistance Movement” in English. It was founded by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin who was a Palestinian cleric. After doing Islamic scholarship in Cairo, he was associated with the local branches of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the 1960s, Yassin preached religious sermons in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Subsequently, in December 1987, Yassin established Hamas as the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza. This came in the backdrop of the first intifada – Palestinian attacks against Israel for alleged atrocities in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. Initially, Hamas believed that Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was a threat to the Muslim Brotherhood so it did everything to ‘counter’ it. In 1988, Hamas published its charter which called for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic society in historic Palestine. Since April 1993, Hamas has been carrying out suicide bombings. The first reported bombing was done five months before PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the Oslo Accords. The historic accord led to the establishment of limited self-government for parts of the West Bank and Gaza. A new entity called the Palestinian Authority (PA) was created for this purpose. However, Hamas condemned and tried to derail these developments towards peace. It also condemned the PLO’s and Israel’s recognition of each other.Later, in 1997, the United States designated Hamas a foreign terrorist organisation as it went on to spearhead violent resistance during the second intifada, in the early 2000s. Hamas’s founder, Yassin was killed by Israeli forces in 2004.Apart from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), Hamas is the other major outfit in Palestinian territories. Since 2006, the Islamist outfit Hamas has controlled the Gaza Strip. Back then, it defeated its rival political party, Fatah, in elections but after that, there hasn’t been any election in the Palestinian enclave.It is notable that the Palestine state is divided into two territories, the Werst Bank on the east of Israel, and the Gaza Strip on the west. While Hamas governs Gaza, the governance of the West Bank, the much larger territory bordering Jordan and the Dead Sea apart from Israel, is complicated. While the West Bank is generally under the occupation is Israel, there are a large number of Palestinian enclaves that are under total or partial control of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).While anti-Israel sentiments prevail in the entire Palestinian state, this sentiment is strongest in the Gaza Strip, which is under Hamas rule.Gaza Strip is a 41km-long and 6-12 km-wide territory between Israel, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea. It has one of the highest population densities in the world with a population of about 2.3 million people. Israel exercises control over the airspace above Gaza and its coastline, regulating the entry and exit of people and goods through its border crossings. Likewise, Egypt governs the passage of individuals into and out of Gaza through its border. According to the UN, almost 80% of the Gazans depend on international aid, and about one million people rely on daily food aid. However, it is often reported that millions of foreign aid and funds from like-minded countries were funneled to anti-Israel activities including terror attacks. In fact, Hamas which is ‘governing’ the Gaza Strip is notorious for launching attacks, and suicide bombings on Israel. Notably, dozens of nations, including Israel, the United States, and the European Union as a bloc, have classified Hamas as a terrorist organisation, particularly its military wing, due to its involvement in suicide bombings and acts of terror directed against Israel.Hamas has several bodies that perform various political, military, and social functions. There is an overarching consultative body referred to as the politburo. It operates in exile and sees the ‘General policy’ of the outfit. The grassroots issues in Gaza and the West Bank are seen by the local committees of Hamas. Since June 2021, Gaza’s de facto prime minister is Issam al-Da’alis.Whereas, Ismail Haniyeh is the political head after he replaced longtime leader Khaled Meshaal in 2017. Since 2020, he along with other Hamas leadership has been operating from Doha in Qatar because Egypt limited his movement into and out of Gaza. Previously, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. Meanwhile, some of the Hamas leadership has an office in Turkey and they reportedly operate from there.Meanwhile, Yahya Sinwar who served twenty-two years in an Israeli prison for masterminding the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers sees ‘day-to-day’ affairs in Gaza. He was released from prison along with more than one thousand Palestinian prisoners in 2011 in exchange for an Israeli soldier held by Hamas terrorists.Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, is commanded by Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif. It is important to note that the responsibility for recent terrorist attacks on Israel was taken by Deif stating that Hamas has carried out ‘Operation Al-aqsa storm’.   The founder of Hamas military wing, Salah Shehadeh was assassinated by the Israeli forces in a 2002 air strike. Hamas operates from Lebanon which is reportedly headed by Saleh al-Arouri. He also took over Hamas’ West Bank leadership after internal elections in 2021. Hamas maintains close ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon.Hamas is a designated terrorist entity and for this reason, it is barred from getting official assistance that the United States and European Union (EU) provide to the PLO in the West Bank. Apart from funding from Palestinian expatriates, private donors in the Persian Gulf, and Islamic charities in the West, Hamas reportedly gets financial and other support from Iran, Turkey, and Qatar among other Islamic nations.   Iran is one of the biggest benefactors of Hamas as it contributes funds, weapons, and training to fight a proxy war against Israel. Iran pumps funds to the tune of $100 million annually to Hamas, PIJ, and other Palestinian outfits designated as terrorist organisations by the United States.However, during the Syrian civil war, Iran and Hamas had a brief fallout with each other.Qatar also provides hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to Gaza through Hamas. However, foreign aid generally reaches Gaza via the PA and UN agencies. Earlier, Hamas amassed funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood. Afterwards, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Additionally, Turkey is another backer of the Hamas particularly after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rose to power in 2002. Though it claims that it backs Hamas only politically, Ankara has been accused of funding Hamas’s terrorism, including through aid diverted from the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency.Hamas has been in control of Gaza since Israel’s withdrawal from the territory in 2005. In the subsequent year, Hamas got a majority of seats in the PA’s legislative body and established a government. It is claimed that Palestinians believed that Fatah’s leadership had become corrupt during its tenure within the PLO and had achieved limited progress in Palestinian-Israeli negotiations which resulted in Hamas getting the majority, after which it has never conducted an election. Since 2006, Palestinians have not voted for a legislature, nor for a president since 2008.However, Fatah rejected the outcome of the elections and the party ousted Hamas from power in the West Bank. While in Gaza, Hamas hunted down Fatah’s militias to extend its authoritative control.  In theory, Hamas follows the Sharia-based Palestinian Basic Law, as does the PA. However, Hamas is notorious for implementing an extreme version of Sharia, including controlling how women dress and enforcing gender segregation in public during the early years of its rule. It has repressed media, civilian activism on social media, the political opposition, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Gaza who argue that more focus should be diverted towards the welfare of Gazans than launching terror attacks on Israel.Hamas has been firing a spree of rockets and mortars into Israel after it took over Gaza. Iranian security officials admitted that Tehran provided some of these weapons. However, after getting training from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and proxies, Hamas has been building its own missiles as well. Additionally, Hamas has been dropping hundreds of balloons laden with inflammatory substances and explosives, along with rockets on Israeli territories causing indiscriminate death and destruction to civilians. Israel has responded fiercely and unsparingly against the continued provocation, with persistent airstrikes and tank fires on locations described by it as Gaza’s military infrastructure installations.Hamas has also launched incursions into Israeli territory, and it is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks including the recent one which is still ongoing. One of the most infamous incidents occurred in 2006 when they kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. In exchange for Shalit’s release, Israel released more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners, including Sinwar. Additionally, in 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of abducting and killing three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

26,"8 October, 2023 ","‘My son is not a criminal’, says the mother of Nilesh Parmar who was arrested after Vadodara incident where Islamists pelted stones on Ganesh Visarjan Yatra"," Earlier, OpIndia had also spoken to the local Savli police station about the incident. The local police confirmed the arrest of Nilesh Parmar.During the Ganpati Visarjan procession at Manjusar in Vadodara, a Muslim mob pelted stones at Hindu procession. Many people were injured in the attack and the idol of Lord Ganesha was also damaged. Both parties lodged complaints with the police after the stone pelting. During their operation, the police detained a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker from Savli, Nilesh Parmar, and later sent him to Ahmedabad Central Jail under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA). Hindu organisations and locals opposed the action, calling it unfair. In the meantime, OpIndia contacted Nilesh Parmar’s family and tried to know their side.Nilesh Parmar, an RSS volunteer, hails from the village of Gothada in Savli taluka. This village predominantly consists of Muslim residents, with the village sarpanch also being of the Muslim faith. We spoke to his mother, Madhuben Thakorbhai Parmar. Throughout our discussion, Madhuben’s voice exhibited a sense of distress, clearly affected by the recent turn of events involving her son. Throughout our interaction, Madhuben consistently asserted that Nilesh was entirely innocent. She claimed that Nilesh was present at a different location on the day of the incident in question. She said that Nilesh had actually gone out to attend a social gathering.When OpIndia spoke to Nilesh’s mother Madhuben, she said at the very beginning of the conversation that her 26-year-old son was not guilty in any way. He is an RSS volunteer and always raises his voice for the country, religion and society leading from the front. Madhuben said, “Our village is Muslim majority and the sarpanch is also a Muslim. There are frequent clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the village and taluka. In such a situation, Nilesh has become a known face among Hindus due to his service work at a young age. Seeing this, the local political leaders started feeling jealous. That’s why he is often being targeted in this way.”Nilesh’s mother further said, “This is not the first time that my son’s name has been linked to a crime without any reason. Even before this, Nilesh’s name has been wrongly linked in various complaints many times. His name is not mentioned in the primary complaint, then later his name is added to the statements of the accused due to political pressure.”When we talked about the incident in Manjusar, she said, “Sangeetaben Sanjaybhai Parmar of our family died on the same day and at the same time as the incident in Manjusar. So our entire family, including Nilesh, was engaged in a post-death ritual here. Nilesh was not present at the spot where the commotion took place. His name has been wrongly added to the statement by the police under political pressure.”While talking further, Madhuben became emotional remembering her son. She told OpIndia that her son was falsely implicated. She demanded justice for her son. We asked her about her son’s affiliation with RSS. She said, “My son was involved with RSS since childhood, is now in RSS and will continue to be so. While working in the RSS, he has been doing many service works for the local people which he is proud of.”OpIndia also spoke to Nilesh’s cousin Kewal Parmar. He also said that his brother had been falsely implicated. Kewal said, “Earlier in 2021, Nilesh had organised a street march of RSS in Gothada village. Even then, it was opposed by the local Muslims and the Muslim sarpanch who said that the RSS yatra should not be taken out in our village. At that time too, Nilesh was harassed a lot.”Kewal further said, “Nilesh was gradually becoming popular among the local Hindu community and Hindu youths for his service work. In a Muslim-dominated area like Savli, he expanded the scope of the RSS work. Due to this, there were many attempts to implicate him in a false case repeatedly.”Finally, he said that no matter what happens, he will not give up and will continue to fight on every judicial path to get justice for his brother Nilesh Parmar.Earlier, OpIndia had also spoken to the local Savli police station about the incident. The local police confirmed the arrest of Nilesh Parmar. At the same time, PSI Anirudh Kamaliya clarified, “An investigation is currently underway to find out whether Nilesh Parmar was involved in the Manjusar incident. However, Nilesh Parmar has been sent to Sabarmati jail under PASA after his name cropped up in complaints against both sides and his name cropped up in more than three similar offences.”On Thursday (28th September), there was an incident of stone pelting during Ganesh Visarjan at Manjusar in Savli taluka of Vadodara. In this incident, some Hindus were injured and the idol of Lord Ganesha was also broken. In this case, the police have registered an FIR against 18 people and the mob of the remaining 30 unidentified people and further investigation is underway. On the other hand, it has been learned through reports that 5 accused of stone-pelting have also been arrested.वडोदरा के मुंजसर मैं गणेश विसर्जन पर कल किए गए पथराव की तस्वीरें आयी सामने.पथराव करने वाले फ़िलहाल गाँव छोड़कर भाग निकले.पुलिस ने फ़िलहाल पाँच लोगो को पकड़ा है बाक़ियो को ढूँढा जा रहा है. https://t.co/y7GpjqiOup pic.twitter.com/GHJFnblQCpThe incident took place in Manjusar village of Savli. Videos of this incident have also surfaced on social media. In these videos, it is seen that miscreants wearing face masks threw stones from the roofs of the houses. Islamic posters were also put up in the building from where the stones were thrown. It is learnt that the stone pelters are currently absconding and efforts are on to trace them.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

27,"14 October, 2023 ","“Today I realise how lucky we are as Indians”, Shehla Rashid credits PM Modi for peace and safety in Kashmir after prosecution sanction granted against her"," Though Shehla Rashid has turned off replies to these tweets, many people have lauded her for speaking the truth about the changed reality of Kashmir particularly after the abrogation of Article 370. On 14th October (Saturday), JNU alumna and Kashmir-based ‘activist’ Shehla Rashid took to X to heap praise on PM Modi, the administration in Jammu and Kashmir along with the Indian Army in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. Reacting to the fast-paced developments in the Middle East, she asserted that these developments have made her realise how lucky we are as Indians.  In her post, she wrote, “Looking at the events in the Middle East, today I realise how lucky we are as Indians. The Indian Army and security forces have sacrificed their everything for our safety. Credit where it’s due.”Looking at the events in the Middle East, today I realise how lucky we are as Indians. The Indian Army and security forces have sacrificed their everything for our safety.Credit where it's due @pmoindia @HMOIndia @manojsinha_ @adgpi @ChinarcorpsIA for bringing peace to Kashmir https://t.co/qeUCkJq9g3She also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Manoj Sinha, the Indian Army, and the Chinar Corps of the Indian Army for bringing peace to Jammu and Kashmir.Former JNU alumna Shehla Rashid also noted that peace can’t be ensured without security and the ongoing crisis in the Middle East stamps it further. She added that the Chinar Corps of the Indian Army, along with the brave soldiers of the CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir Police, have made tremendous sacrifices to ensure long-term peace and security in Kashmir.Peace is impossible without security, as the Middle East crisis has shown. The Indian Army @ChinarcorpsIA along with @crpfindia and brave personnel of Jammu Kashmir Police @JmuKmrPolice have made tremendous sacrifices to ensure long-term peace and security in Kashmir 🙏Though Shehla Rashid has turned off replies to these tweets, many people have lauded her for speaking the truth about the changed reality of Kashmir particularly after the abrogation of Article 370. However, in the past, she had an illustrious career in peddling fake news and spreading anti-India rhetoric in Kashmir. Notably, she has previously served as the former vice-president of the JNU student union and did politics on behalf of AISA, the student organisation of left parties. Back then, she made regular statements against BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even resorted to fake news peddling on many instances to show a false narrative of Muslims being victimised in Jammu and Kashmir by the ‘oppressive’ Indian Armed forces.   In one instance, she even went to peddle fake news to implicate the Indian army in a bad light and toed the line of Pakistani propaganda against the security forces which was exposed by the Indian Army. In a series of tweets, Rashid alleged that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is grim and that the armed forces are using excessive force on the Kashmiris. It is notable that Shehla Rashid’s change of heart in the matter comes just days after the Delhi LG granted sanction for a case against her over her comments spreading fake news. Supreme Court lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava had filed a criminal complaint against Shehla Rashid for her comments, seeking her arrest for allegedly spreading fake news against the Indian Army and the government. The complaint stated that she had prima facie committed an offence of sedition under Section 124-A of IPC. It added that Rashid has further committed offences of ‘promoting enmity between the classes’ under Sections 153, 153-A, 504, and 505 of IPC.In connection to her baseless tweets against the Indian army, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, VK Saxena on 10th January, this year granted prosecution sanction against Shehla Rashid. It allowed the prosecution to charge her under section 196 of CrPC, 1973, for her tweets against the Indian Army. For the last few days, the Former JNUSU Vice President Shehla Rashid has spent time in Kashmir, and post the prosecution sanction against her in connection to the fake news against the Indian Army, she has been retracting some of her earlier stances. For example, she had once approached the Supreme Court against the decision to abrogate Article 370. However, she recently withdrew her petition over this issue. Similarly, earlier this year, on the occasion of Independence Day, she responded positively to the news of Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist Javed’s brother Raees Mattoo hoisting the Indian national flag. Reflecting on that, she had also asserted that the situation has improved in the state followed by recent tweets where she has underscored the changed reality of Kashmir and praised PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for peace and safety in Kashmir.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

At the same time, they were heard raising slogans of ‘Intifada Inquilab.’ The Hamas supporters were part of the Students Islamic Organisation (SIO) of India, which is the student wing of the radical Jamaat-e-Islami Hind.

29,"13 October, 2023 ","Ladakh Congress working president justifies Hamas atrocities on innocent Israelis, tries to falsely project ‘Palestinian Mujahideens’ as victims"," Umpteen visuals are available on the internet that depict the extent of brutality and savagery that Hamas has inflicted on Israeli civilians.Along the lines of his higher-ups in Delhi, Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of Ladakh Congress has declared his unwavering support for the Palestinians and their terrorist organisation Hamas, which has been committing horrific atrocities and war crimes against Israel since it launched an unprecedented attack on the nation on October 7. ‘Hamas Mujahideen from Gaza have started to take back their land from America’s pet Israel, killed and kidnapped Israeli soldiers. They have shown Israel ke wajood ki koi haisiyat nahi hai’: Congress Working President, Ladakh pic.twitter.com/9oBM9Dr4YgThe Islamist terrorist organisation Hamas has been inflicting unspeakable violent crimes on Israeli civilians, including brutal murders, the beheading of children, rape, kidnap and taking hostage, yet the Congress leader, in a video shared by Times Now, is heard hailing the Hamas terrorists and justifying the atrocities they have been committing.He can be heard applauding the ‘Hamas Mujahideen’ from Gaza for carrying out attacks against Israel, which he refers to as the slave of the ‘biggest devils’- the United States of America. The Congress leader further lauded the Palestinians for conquering back their land which he claimed they lost to the Israelis.The Congress leader proudly admitted that Hamas terrorists have killed and kidnapped several Israeli soldiers while justifying the atrocities that Hamas perpetrated against Israel and its defence forces as well as its innocent citizens. He exulted that the Palestinian mujahideen had shown to the world that they would never submit to the Israelis despite all the constraints, sanctions, and repression.Further gushing over the war Hamas has declared against Israel, he said that the Palestinians have proven that “Israel ke wajood ki koi haisiyat nahi hai. Woh makde ke jaale see bhi kamjor hai, yeh unhone 7 October ko dikhla diya” (the existence of Israel is worthless. It is weaker than a spider’s web. This the Palestinians proved on October 7), he said.Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of the Ladakh Congress, continued to blatantly lie projecting Israelis as the aggressors and the Palestinians as the victims despite the fact that Israel only launched counterattacks on Gaza as retaliation to the devastation and mass destruction Hamas terrorists caused in Israel. He claimed that the Israeli soldiers killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians and massacred their babies. Though it is true that many civilians from both sides have fallen prey to the war that was started by the Hamas terrorists on October 7, there are umpteen videos and images available on the internet that depict the extent of brutality and savagery members of the Islamists terror organisation Hamas have inflicted on Israeli civilians and defence personnel in these last 5 days. The numerous distressing visuals that have surfaced on social media, in fact, serve as evidence that Hamas terrorists have murdered over 1300 innocent Israeli people, including women, the elderly, and newborns, by shooting, stabbing, beheading, and even burning them alive. In fact, on Thursday, October 12, the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel took the extraordinary step of releasing gruesome photos of murdered babies to reporters and the public, seeking to underscore the atrocities carried out by Hamas in its savage rampage through southern Israel on Saturday. OpIndia also listed 15 such videos showing how Hamas targeted innocent civilians and inflicted brutalities in Israel.The views of Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of Ladakh Congress, were in tandem with his party supremos who had also expressed sympathy for Palestinians. A resolution passed on October 9, by the Congress Working Committee (CWC) voiced concern over the situation and urged for a ceasefire.

30,"13 October, 2023 ",Politics of prisoners heats up in Tamil Nadu: Muslim groups demand the release of 36 Muslim prisoners after AIADMK sought the release of Coimbatore blast convicts," CM Stalin questioned AIADMK for their sudden demand for the release of Muslim prisoners, while BJP has opposed the demandPolitics have heated up in Tamil Nadu over the demand to release Muslim prisoners from jail, including those convicted in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast. Opposition parties including AIADMK, which recently exited NDA, are demanding the release of Muslim prisoners who have served a long time in jail. BJP is opposing the demand, while DMK is questioning AIADMK’s sudden love for Muslim prisoners. DMK is also trying to take a secular stand here, saying there the govt will not see prisoners based on their religion.The matter was raised in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday when a motion was raised seeking the release of the 36 Muslim prisoners. Almost all opposition parties in the assembly supported the motion, except BJP. Raising the matter in assembly, AIADMK leader Edappadi K Palaniswami urged the state to release them. He cited their health conditions and added that they have been in prison for more than 20 years. Palaniswami said that several political parties had been demanding the release of these prisoners and the state government should heed their plea.Several other MLAs from different parties made similar demands. Responding to the same, CM MK Stalin said that the government has already taken steps to release prisoners. He said that the state government had set up a six-member committee, led by retired Madras High Court judge, Justice N Authinathan, in December 2021 to look into the matter.The panel had recommended the release of 224 prisoners, following which the state decided to first release 49 prisoners, of which 20 were Muslim. The chief minister said the documents on the release were pending with Governor RN Ravi for his assent.Stalin also questioned AIADMK for their sudden demand for the release of Muslim prisoners. “While in power you didn’t take any steps to release Muslim prisoners. You blindly supported CAA and NRC. We and the minority community clearly know why AIADMK is showing such affection towards Muslim prisoners now”, said the CM.On the other hand, BJP has objected to the demand. State BJP chief K Annamalai has cautioned the state government against the premature release of the terrorists serving life imprisonment in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast case. Annamalai said he believed that terrorism shouldn’t be confined to a religion or community.In February 1998, a bomb blast by Radical Islamic Fundamentalists in a serene city like Coimbatore led to the loss of 58 lives and injured over 200.The SC last week stuck down the bail application filed by a few convicts in this case & reiterated it as an atrocious act. Despite…Annamalai wrote on X that he hoped good sense would prevail and Chief Minister M K Stalin would stop “his misadventure of releasing the radical Islamic fundamentalists” from prison.Apart from political parties, other organisations also have joined the demand. Several Muslim organisations held a protest in Chennai on Wednesday, 11 October, demanding the release of 36 Muslim prisoners serving jail terms on terror charges. The protest was led by the Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi (MJK), and it was organised outside the Triplicane mosque in Chennai, India Today reported.Muslim Organisations held protests in Chennai for the release of 36 Muslim prisoners serving life imprisonment for more than 20 years.#ReporterDiary (@PramodMadhav6) pic.twitter.com/Zi7TM9UpltThe Protestors also burnt the image of CM MK Stalin and raised slogans against the government. Later all the protesters were detained by the Chennai police.General Secretary of Manidhaneya Jananayaka Katchi, Taminun Ansari said “We held a protest today in Chennai demanding prisoners who served more than 20 years in Tamil Nadu prison should be released. We also thank the political parties who support our demand. We are shocked that the CM said in the Assembly that they have sent this to the Governor where already 22 bills are pending. We are going to siege the assembly now.”“Rape convicts in Bilkis Bano case were prematurely released by the Gujarat government. They have no moral rights to speak about this”, Thameemul Ansari said justifying the demand.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

31,"12 October, 2023 ","New Karnataka education policy: Yogendra Yadav, the protestor for hire, and Professor Japhet, who drafted anti-superstition bill specifically targeting Hindu rituals, part of committee"," It is notable that the ""Duggal Sahab"" of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers' protest in which he took the avatar of a 'farmer leader' was a ""political stunt"" meant to oust BJP from power.On Wednesday (11th October), the Congress government in Karnataka constituted a committee of ‘experts’ to formulate the Karnataka State Education Policy which would replace the National Education Policy (NEP). The state government has issued a ‘Government Order’ (GO) forming a 15-member committee headed by Professor and former Delhi UGC Chairman Sukhdev Thorat, with a secondary group of eight subject experts/advisers rendering expert input. The committee will submit its report on February 28 next year.“The government is pleased to accord sanction to the State Education Policy Commission for the preparation of a draft Karnataka State Education Policy under the chairmanship of Professor Sukhdev Thorat, an eminent Educationist. Economist, Professor, Writer and Former Chairman of UGC New Delhi,” the GO stated.As per the government circular, the 15-member committee includes- Professor S Japhet, Founding Director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP), Sudhir Krishnaswamy, Vice Chancellor of National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Sharat AnanthaMurthy, Professor, School of Physics, University of Hyderabad, A Narayana, Professor at Azim Premji University’s School of Policy and Governance, among others.Meanwhile, Bhagyavana S Mudigoudra, Special Officer, Department of Higher Education, will be the commission’s Member Secretary, coordinating and maintaining the meeting’s proceedings.Today, the Karnataka Government announced the formation of a 15-member committee tasked with crafting a new education policy for the state. In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established to provide insights and guidance in this endeavour. pic.twitter.com/4Qkms8a342In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established for expert advice. It is interesting to note that the eight-member expert group includes protestor for hire Yogendra Yadav alongside Professor Rahamath Tarikere, Retd Professor in Kannada, Kannada University, Hampi; Professor Janaki Nair, Historian and Retd, Professor at the Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Sonam Wangchuk, Engineer turned Education Reformer and Director of the Himalayan Institute of Alternatives, Ladakh (HIAL), Professor Valerian Rodrigues, and two others.It is notable that the “Duggal Sahab” of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers’ protest in which he took the avatar of a ‘farmer leader’ was a “political stunt” meant to oust BJP from power. Moreover, Yadav had also given a similar statement in a debate on NDTV on 10 March 2022 while discussing the UP Assembly Election results. He said the farmer’s movement led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha played a vital role in building the foundation for the opposition parties to defeat the BJP in UP, however, the opposition parties essentially the Samajwadi Party did not play well.Unsurprisingly, Yogendra Yadav also has links with the controversial financier and regime change specialist George Soros. It is notable that in February this year, George Soros openly expressed his disdain for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of crony capitalism saying that he has good relationships with businessman Gautam Adani. OpIndia has published detailed reports on George Soros’s Open Society Foundations (OSF) which has been backing anti-India elements operating inside India.It is worth noting that previous UGC chairman Sukhdev Thorat, who would lead the aforementioned committee, has been a vocal opponent of reservations for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS). Thorat stated his discontent with the ‘upper caste’ Hindus, primarily Brahmins, “dominating” India’s power structure in an interview with Islamist propaganda portal Maktoob Media. Additionally, he insinuated that caste-based reservations should be applied to the private sector in order to narrow the gap between the upper castes and the SC, ST, and OBCs in terms of indicators like life expectancy, child mortality, etc.It is worth recalling that Professor S Japhet, founding director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP) was a prominent player in drafting the controversial Anti-Superstition Bill, in 2013. It is worth noting that the bill intended to outlaw ‘superstitious practices’ was a pet project of Karnataka CM P Siddaramaiah.The controversial bill aimed to ban practices like made snana which involved any person or persons roll over (uruli seve) on the leaves of leftover food by other persons in any public or religious places or similar practices saying that it violated human dignity. Performing fire walks during Jatras and religious festivals, Baibiga practice which involved piercing of the jaw from one side to another, Mata mantra, Gandra Dora practices for treating snake, scorpion or dog bites etc were deemed inhuman acts.“Creating panic in the minds of the public in general by way of invoking ghosts or mantras. Persuading, propagating or facilitating rituals that involve self-inflicted injuries such as hanging from a hook: inserted into the body (sidi) or pulling a chariot by hook inserted into the body,” the bill stated.While the bill included self-inflicting injuries to define Hindu rituals, the bill did not mention Muharram, an occasion of mourning for the Shia sect of Muslims who inflict injuries to their own bodies using chains and sharp objects in public places. Moreover, the bill mentioned ‘ghosts’ and practices performed on the pretext of expelling them from the person possessed including physical assault and forcing one to perform sexual acts, however, there was no mention of Satan, Shaitan and Jinn and weird practices involved in expelling them from a person ‘possessed’ by them.Back in 2013, Professor Japhet had said that through the bill an attempt has been made to “define the superstitious practices as those that cause grave physical, mental or sexual exploitation or offends human dignity”. It is amusing that Japhet failed to or deliberately did not ‘define’ comparable superstitious practices in other religions.Notably, after much outrage from the people and political parties, the bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature in 2017 when Congress leader Siddaramaiah was the chief minister of Karnataka.Two years before drafting the bill, Japhet wrote an extensive piece on the plight of Dalit Christians in 2011, in which he admitted that Christians from non-Dalit communities discriminate against Christians who convert from Dalit communities. Despite this, S Japhet did not include evangelism and conversion based on the promise of equality as a superstition.The formation of a committee to frame Karnataka state education policy comes after the Congress government had in August announced that its government will implement its own policy rejecting the Centre’s NEP. In May this year, Siddaramiah had said that he would not allow the education sector to be adulterated in the name of the new education policy.Siddaramaiah claimed that the Central Government’s national education agenda is ‘incompatible’ with the federal form of governance. “It has several anomalies that undermine the Constitution and democracy,” remarked the Chief Minister. “Uniform education system does not suit a nation like India which has diverse religions, languages and cultures”. While the chief minister asserted that the NEP will not ‘suit’ India since the country has diverse languages, the NEP directs to lay “emphasis on promoting multilingualism and Indian languages; The medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home language/mother tongue/local language/regional language.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

32,"13 October, 2023 ",Lessons from Hamas’ attack on Israel: The fake ‘Genocide of Muslims’ narrative in India will be used to justify Genocide of Hindus as ‘language of oppressed’," Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door - which they do almost on a regular basisRight before dawn 5 days ago on a Saturday, Israel woke up to her worst nightmare. As the sirens blared and citizens of Israel looked for shelter, a couple of thousand Islamic terrorists from Hamas attacked the bewildered civilians from air, sea and land. As thousands of rockets and missiles rained down on Israel leaving in its wake destruction and a trail of dead bodies strewn on the streets, hundreds of terrorists on motorbikes, on foot and followed by tractors breached the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Simultaneously, terrorists also attached the beaches of Israel riding on motorbikes, overwhelming the unsuspecting Israeli soldiers. As the embers and smoke engulfed Israel, some of the Islamic terrorists descended on paragliders. After descending on Israel, the terrorists went city to city, village to village and kibbutz to kibbutz hunting down women, children and men alike. The visuals from the assault could perhaps be classified as traumatising, but worlds fall short when the Jihadi barbarity is laid threadbare, captured in images of charred bodies, burnt babies, raped and dishonoured women, and bloodied and murdered men. Several Jews were taken hostage by the terrorists as they cried and screamed for help, amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, they were beaten, spat on, dishonoured and kidnapped – carried at the back of their trucks to Gaza. The wound of seeing babies bloodied and murdered is one that Israel and the Jewish community would perhaps never be able to heal from. From babies who slept peacefully in their cribs to partygoers dancing their worries away, where 260 of them were slaughtered, the Muslim terrorists spared none. Amidst the scent of death and blood, the wails of tragic loss, the cries for help and the screams of rage, Israel rose as one. Several Israelis travelled back from wherever they were in the world to seek justice – to seek retribution. Old, young, men and women got called into duty – to defend the civilisational home of the Jews and to ensure those who had the blood of children and women on their hands paid a price for their barbarism. Israel then began to pound Gaza with rockers and missiles, flattening whatever stood in its path. On the 13th of October, Israel asked 1.1 million Palestinians to move from the North to the South – the instruction included for UN officials and those hiding in their premises to relocate as well – signalling that Israel was ready for a ground assault. Israel has also shut down the water and electricity supply of Palestine. Israel pleaded with the world – don’t look away. Look at the biggest onslaught against Jews since the Holocaust. Look at what the Islamic terrorists have done. They have killed our babies. Raped our women. Beheaded our sons. They want us gone – annihilated – murdered – humiliated. Don’t. Look. Away – they pleaded. They pleaded because they knew that as a country that fights for its very survival everyday will not be cowered down and that retribution will be theirs. As expected, when Israel started responding to Palestine’s mass violence against Jews, the narrative was not too kind to them, despite the fact that most countries which often gloss over Islamist violence came out vehemently in support of Israel – USA for example. Almost immediately, the narrative shifted to the brewing humanitarian crisis in Palestine with Israel shutting off its water and electricity supply. In one video, the former Prime Minister of Israel screamed – What is wrong with you? We are fighting the Nazis. How can you expect us to give water and electricity to our enemies”. 'Are you seriously asking me about Palestinian civilians? What is wrong with you? We're fighting Nazis.'Former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett adds 'if Hamas use anyone as a human shield, it is their responsibility.'https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3📺 Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/19nBKjOYOQThe media, however, continued what it does best – whitewash the crimes of Muslims and blame the victims of violence of genocide when they choose to stand up and say – ‘Thus far and no further’. The essence of these articles was simple – Israel is committing a genocide of Palestinians by way of its retaliatory action after Jews were raped, murdered, beheaded or injured. They were careful – though. They were careful to also give a “context” to the Palestinian attack against Israel. In an article headlined, “Palestinian Americans, Dismayed by Violence, Say Historical Context Is Being Overlooked”, The New York Times essentially provided context to the mass murder of rape of Jews by Islamic terrorists. The article said, “In interviews with more than a dozen Palestinian Americans, many said they were saddened by the violence against civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, and hoped for a peaceful resolution. But many said that the underlying causes of the conflict could be traced to the policies of Israel and the United States, and decades of Palestinians being denied freedom of movement and basic rights”. The subtle agenda-pushing is a work of art that must be fully appreciated. In the article, the New York Times essentially pushes the narrative that Palestinians are lovely people who are very very… very sad about the “loss of lives” in Israel. They are empathetic and don’t support terrorism of any form. However, they are also terribly sad that the USA and perhaps the rest of the world are not understanding the historical context of why these lovely, peaceful, delightful people from Palestine raped, beheaded and tortured Jews in Israel. In turn and as a result, while it was the Jews who got raped, beheaded and tortured, it was the Palestinians who were the real victims not only because Israel launched a counteroffensive against them but also because the barbaric, Islamophobic world was refusing to understand why the Palestinians were forced to murder babies, rape women, behead civilians and torture/murder the men. Further in the New York Times article, another Palestinian is quoted saying the following: “These statements are really dehumanizing us,” she said, “and telling us that our lives are not worth anything.” In the eyes of those officials, she added, “we are never the victim, we are always the aggressor.”This statement was made in response to US’ support to Israel and statements demanding action against Hamas for their misadventure. But do you see what happened here? While the entire article asserted that the Muslims were the victims whether they were killing Israelis, facing retaliatory action or celebrating the murder of Jews, the Palestinian quoted here craftily plays victim to negate the incontrovertible fact that Islamic terrorists are indeed the aggressors. While these op-eds try to paint the Islamic terrorists as “Gandhis with guns”, they gloss over the fact that Gaza has been officially ruled by Hamas since 2017. They gloss over the fact that it is not just Hamas – Palestinians take to the streets to celebrate atrocities against Jews on a regular basis. They gloss over the fact that they may attempt to differentiate between Hamas and civilian Palestinians, but even the civilian Palestinians don’t differentiate between the state of Israel and average, civilian Jews because in the Hamas onslaught, celebrated by Palestinians and Muslims across the globe, those killed were average Jews, average Israelis – women, children, elderly. When we look at the incidents in Israel, this is what the apologists want the world to believe. Interestingly, there is an uncanny parallel to how the world arm twists Hindus every time they come under the attack of Islamists. The parallels of the narrative being crafted post-Hamas violence in Israel and the narrative which is crafted every single time Hindus come under the assault of Islamists have several parallels and lessons that Hindus can draw. While Hamas burnt alive Jewish victims in Israel, Dilbar Negi’s hands and legs were chopped off and he was burnt alive by Islamists in India just 3 years ago. The narrative has been eerily constant regardless of established facts – whether we discuss the partition horrors against Hindus or the current aggressions against Hindus. In this regard, it would bode well to remember the case of Mahashay Rajpal, who published Rangeela Rasool and was ultimately assassinated for it. We mostly hear that Mahashay Rajpal was assassinated for publishing a satirical work on Prophet Muhammad called Rangeela Rasool, but we seldom hear why he chose to publish the book. In 1923, Muslims published two particularly offensive books to Hindus. “Krishna teri geeta jalani padegi” used derogatory and vulgar language against Shri Krishna and other Hindu deities and “Uniseevi sadi ka maharshi” which contained derogatory remarks on Arya Samaj founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati (incidentally written by an Ahmadi).In response to this provocation by Islamists, Pandit Chamupati Lal, a close friend of Mahashay Rajpal, wrote a short biography of the Islamic Prophet, Mohammed. “Rangeela Rasool” was a short pamphlet which satirised the life of the Prophet of Islam. Pandit Chamupati made Mahashay Rajpal promise that he would never reveal the name of the author – he knew the consequences of it. Anonymously published under the name “doodh ka doodh aur panee ka panee”, the book enraged Muslims. Staying true to the values of one-way brotherhood, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote in his pamphlet “Young India”, condemning Rangeela Rasool. While Gandhi ignored the provocation by Muslims, by the end of June 1924, the colonial government banned the book. The Muslim community, partly emboldened by MK Gandhi’s endorsement of their hurt sentiments and whitewashing of the provocation against Hindus, filed multiple cases against the book under 153A. In May 1927, Mahashay Rajpal, who published the book, was acquitted of all charges with the court observing that commentary based on facts on historical figures, including the prophet of Islam, cannot be said to promote enmity between groups. As soon as the verdict was delivered, Muslim mobs went into a frenzy. They rioted and demanded the head of Mahashay Rajpal. They were chants about how the murder of Rajpal was acceptable because, under Sharia, the punishment for blasphemy is death.On April 6th, 1929 a 19-year-old carpenter named Ilm ud din stabbed Mahashay Rajpal on his chest eight times while he was seated in the outer verandah of his shop. Though he was offered to give up the name of the author, Pandit Chamupati Lal, during the court proceedings, he refused and did not yield. He paid the price for it. He paid the price for publishing that book despite the court acquitting him and the Muslims getting a special law to protect their fragile feelings. Before Mahashay Rajpal was murdered brutally, the Muslims got their way and got 295A passed by the British, which aimed to protect their ever-outraged feelings. In this case too, it was the Islamists who mounted the initial onslaught by publishing books insulting Hindus. It was the Hindus who published one book in return. The response to that was the Muslims going on a rampage, rioting, committing violence and beheading Mahashay Rajpal. Through it all, it was the Hindus who were condemned by MK Gandhi while the Muslims, who indulged in violence, became the eternal victims getting a law to protect their feelings. Any conversation around this subject, till date, conveniently glosses over the Muslims publishing the two books first and their rampant violence later – what is remembered is that Hindus published a book that hurt Muslims and that Hindus are the community that must be blamed for the murder of Mahashay Rajpal because the Muslim hurt was justified. Not too long after India was torn apart by those who were convinced that the Muslim community could be placated. Before the Rangeela Rasool controversy, Hindus saw the Khilafat movement, and the support it got from Congress and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and after that, Hindus saw the rise of a Muslim leader like Mohammad Ali Jinnah, leading India’s partition.16th August 1946 was the day when the call to massacre Hindus of Bengal was given by Muslim League founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Bengal, the only province in India under Muslim League rule at that time, was apparently chosen by the Muslim League leadership as the suitable place to unleash terror on Hindus in the name of “Direct Action”.In 1946, the massacre of Hindus in Bengal was rather intricately planned. Jinnah is recalled having said that he would either have India divided or India burnt and that he had given up on Constitutional methods to demand the creation of Pakistan. Jinnah had chosen the 16th of August as Direction Action Day because it was the 18th day of Ramzan, the day when the Battle of Badr was fought and won – a war fought by Prophet Muhammad himself, against the Kaffirs, and is considered to be won by Allah’s divine intervention by Muslims. The battle led to the violent occupation of Mecca. On the 16th of August, Calcutta was littered with posters lionising Jinnah and reminding Muslims that they had to follow the footsteps of the Prophet. It is reported that Syed Muhammad Usman, mayor of Calcutta, had issued a widely circulated leaflet that said: Kafer! Toder dhongsher aar deri nei! Sarbik hotyakando ghotbei! (Infidels! Your end is not far away! You will be massacred!). The aim was to make Bengal ‘land of the pure’ and rid it of the Kaffirs (Hindus). The aim was to wage another Battle of Badr, in which the Muslims would conquer the heathens. What followed on the 16th right after the Jumma Namaz is Muslims going on a rampage, beheading Hindus, chopping their limbs off and raping Hindu women. Several women were taken as sex slaves by those who were fighting with the religious fervour of the Battle of Badr. In the Kesoram Cotton Mills at Lichubagan in the Muslim-dominated Metiabruz area, Muslim mobs entered and beheaded over 600 labourers. The Hindus, neutered and asked by Gandhi to die with a smile on their face hardly fought back. There was a mass exodus from Bengal that marked millions fleeing because the massacre seemed too brutal to fight against.When Gopal Patha rose to defend the Hindus, it was MK Gandhi who asked him to lay down his weapons. The retaliatory, self-defence action by the Hindus were deemed the original onslaught and the openly religious violence against the Hindus were pushed under the rug to ensure that the Muslims continued to be the universal and eternal victims. Despite the historical atrocities committed by Muslims against Hindus, today, the Media goes no overdrive trying to push the narrative that there is an impending genocide against Muslims that the world is waiting to witness in India. Reams are written on how Hindus harbour animosity against the Muslims, depriving them of their legitimate rights, lynching them, killing them and humiliating them – building up to a genocide – much like that committed supposedly by Israel against Palestine. History and the current onslaught have been systematically whitewashed by historians, scholars, politicians and the corporate media – to an extent that the world has failed to see the realities of the Hindu population. Let us take the Nuh violence recently for example. Thousands of Muslims had descended on Hindus travelling to an area where the dominant demography was of Muslims. they were travelling there to simply worship Lord Shiva on an auspicious day for Hindus. They were pelted with stones, their cars burnt, held hostage inside the temples where the hostages included women and children and attacked with bullets, acid pouches and petrol bombs. Through it all, the narrative was that somehow, it was the Hindus who had provoked the violence because a) they dared to take out a religious procession in an area where Muslims predominantly live after ghettoizing the area and driving Hindus away and b) because of a rumour that a Hindu activist that the Muslims don’t like might be present at the procession – a lie which was spread by the Islamists themselves. Here is how Le Monde wrote about the Nuh violence. First, they turned one-way violence by the Islamists into “violence between Hindus and Muslims” simply because after the one-way violence, the Hindus had decided to defend themselves. Then, they blamed Hindu organisations for “genocide” and “terror” because they dared to speak about the violence and asserted that they would not accept attacks against Hindus. See a pattern with what is happening in Israel? The Islamists unleash violence. Their violence is justified as the language of the oppressed. When Jews decide to defend themselves and retaliate, they are called the aggressors and the terrorists who unleashed violence continue to be the victims, with the real victims being blamed for unleashing hate and genocide simply because they chose to defend themselves. After the brutal beheading of Kanhaiya Lal by two Muslims who then uploaded the beheading video on social media, holding the blood-dripping knife, global media blamed Hindus for asserting that their lives matter too. Here is what the TIME published. At the very onset, author Mansoor shifted the discourse from the beheading of Kanhaiya Lal to supposed ‘chilling calls for revenge’ against the ‘marginalised’ Muslim population. While trying to contextualise the murder of Kanhaiya Lal, Sanya Mansoor suggested that the poor Hindu tailor had drawn the wrath of the Islamists upon himself by supporting the ‘derogatory comments’ of ex-BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma. Meanwhile, Mansoor also tried to shield the co-religionists of the killers and praise them for their token condemnations. “Muslim politicians and Islamic preachers swiftly condemned the killing,” she asserted while conveniently ignoring their collective silence over calls of ‘Sarr tan se juda chants all over India backed by the same people.Do you see the parallels? Here they are: When a Muslim gets lynched because he was a thief and primarily for such reasons, the media and the global world order are quick to call it an onslaught against Muslims by Hindus, however, when Hindus are lynched, beheaded, raped and murdered for explicitly religious reasons amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, the Hindus have been historically blamed for the violence by the Muslims claiming that the Muslims are indulging in violence because the Hindus have somehow enraged them enough to go on a justified murderous rampage. To prove their point, they even invent crimes where they claim Muslims were beaten up amid Hindu religious slogans simply to justify crimes against Hindus amid chants of Allahu Akbar. They’re lies, screamed from the mountaintops versus our truths meekly repeated, with nobody to listen to us – that is the battle that Hindus have been fighting for millennia. History shows that progressively, a violent minority has strengthened the legislative, judicial and societal cover it gets to assert its religious supremacy aspirations. These aspirations are often negotiated after a violent, vehement and shameless assertion of street veto. The State and leaders who are meant to protect Bharat have bent a knee to the street veto and tried their damndest to assuage the perennially offended, the often violent and the perpetually demanding lot. Their constitutional special status keeps getting reaffirmed either by politicians or the judiciary in the hopes that the ever-so-offended lot will not take to the streets and indulge in rampant violence which the state is woefully incapable of controlling simply to prove just how downtrodden and oppressed they truly are. The intolerant minority has often held a sword to Hindus’ neck and forced us to concede that we have oppressed the sword-wielders.In this bargain, the global world order and the media has followed the pattern of demonising the victims of Islamic violence – the Hindus – and paint the aggressors – the Islamists – and the perpetual victims. In the case of Israel, we see large acceptance of their persecution and acknowledgement of her right to retaliate. Even then, the narrative demonising the Jews for fighting for their survival and civilisational identity is strong enough to spark violence and protests against the victims. Hindus have failed to do what the Jews have done spectacularly well – make the world aware of their own genocide, and their own persecution and ensure that normalisation of that hate is not only a punishable offence but one for which the society itself might ostracise you. We saw that play out after Hamas’ attack against Israel – those students from Harvard who blamed Israel for the terror attack against Jews by Islamic terrorists were forced to retract their statements because corporations started pulling away their job offers. The USA – which when it comes to India whitewashes the Islamic terrorists, was grieved and stood firmly behind Israel’s right to self-defence. The Muslim nations that wanted Israel wiped out mostly stood by mute because they knew the world stood by Israel and her right to self-preservation. As Israel flattens Palestine, there is recognition to some extent that the Jews, especially after suffering from the horrors of the Holocaust, will not stand by and get wiped out again. In India, however, partly because of the failure of Hindus themselves and the systematic whitewashing of history and news by scholars, political leaders and the corporate media, wails of persecution often go unnoticed. In fact, they don’t just go unnoticed, the narrative that we see media, Islamists and Leftists build against Israel today, is a constant against India with other players supporting Israel today joining in as well. Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door – which they do almost on a regular basis – because our own leaders are a part of the narrative demonising Hindus. Take Rahul Gandhi for example and how he today shields Islamists by calling IUML secular, endorsing calls to wipe out Sanatan Dharma, seeking foreign intervention to stop the Hindus and a caste census back home to divide the persecuted. The world will look away as Hindus get slaughtered and the narrative being crafted will blame Hindus for their own persecution and genocide, claiming that the violence unleashed by the Islamists is the “Language of the oppressed” – they are doing that today with Israel – but it would be far easier to do it with Hindus because, unlike Israel, we have traitors amongst ourselves and a world that has normalised persecution of Hindus after we failed to talk about our own plight for centuries. Today, far more than ever, Hindus need to learn from the Jews. Bharat needs to learn from Israel. If we don’t talk about our own persecution – nobody will. If we don’t protect our honour – nobody will. If we don’t stand up to our murderers being painted as the victims – nobody will. And if today we don’t realise the threats of Islamic terror and how it comes even for those who weep for the self-proclaimed marginalised Islamists today. The Hindus’ collective right to retain the cultural, religious and ethical integrity of the only land they have has to be held sacrosanct – legislatively, judicially and socially. This is, perhaps, the one lesson that Israel can teach us – that history is screaming out, waiting for Hindus to hear. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

33,"10 October, 2023 ","There is no common brotherhood, only ‘common enemy’: How the Ummah ignores millions of Muslim victims but gets together against Jews, Hindus, and Christians"," There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians.Since Israel declared war following the Hamas terrorist attacks and ground invasion, the majority of the Arab world has rallied in support of Palestine. These countries have a long history of supporting the “Palestinian” cause. However, their support doesn’t stem from the perceived notion of religious fraternity and common brotherhood, colloquially referred to as the concept of Ummah instead it is driven by the hatred for dehumanised non-believers, pejoratively called ‘Kafirs’ (infidels) and shared theological believe of a common enemy. Conspicuously, the responses of the Arab world vis-a-vis alleged atrocities on Muslims by non-believers as against that of Muslims on Muslims underscores the exploitative and preposterous concept called “convenience of victimhood” to serve the end goal of justifying the ‘annihilation’ of non-believers. Here are some antecedents revealing how support for Palestine or Muslims being ‘persecuted’ around the world serves as just a tool to usher in Dar-ul-Islam and make the world ridden from infidelity.  Israel-Palestine neighbours Syria, Egypt, and Jordan among others have fought wars citing the cause of Palestinians, however, they all share a dark history of persecuting Palestinians on their soil or mercilessly committing crimes against the population, which they allege Israel commits against Palestinian Muslims. Evidently, on 17th September 1970, Jordan carried out a massacre of thousands of Palestinians which is notorious as ‘Black September’ for Palestinians. Fifty years ago, King Hussein ordered the Jordanian Army to massacre militants in the refugee camps situated around Amman. Following the royal orders, the Jordanian army launched a brutal crackdown in a bid to retake control of territory occupied by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Jordan.  According to the 2015 census data, there are around 634,000 Palestinians in Jordan out of the total population of 9.5 million. However, Human Rights organisations claim that half of the Jordan population is Palestinian. The ruling Hashemite dynasty of Jordan fears the large population of Palestinians in the country has the power to destabilise the empire.Meanwhile, Pakistan has a deep interest in supporting the Palestinian cause which increased, especially after India started strengthening its relationship with Israel in the 1990s. However, Pakistani leaders have avoided discussing this chapter in Palestinian history: the events of Black September in Jordan in 1970. Notably, Pakistan played a major hand in exterminating Palestinian ‘terrorists’ hiding in refugee camps. Jordan had sought the assistance of Pakistan to train its newly equipped army. As a result, the critical training for the Jordanian army was provided by Pakistan.Another neighbor, Syria which earlier used to mollycoddle Hamas, it acted against Palestinians when they exploited and aggravated civil war in Syria, the nation which was hosting them. Apparently, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. However, normal Gazans or Palestinians didn’t share the same fate as their top brass for participating in the Syrian Civil War. While the Hamas leadership was just shunned from the country, ordinary Palestinians (despite hailing from the Muslim faith) were brutally hacked to death. According to private data gathered by the Action Group for Palestinians of Syria (AGPS), they documented the death of at least 4,013 Palestinians as a result of the war in Syria. The victims included 614 refugees who had died of torture inside Syrian regime prisons and detention centres and 205 who had died due to lack of medical care and the tight siege imposed by the Syrian regime army on the Yarmouk camp in Damascus, the AGPS had revealed. Israeli politician Golda Meir once famously said, “We will have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us”. The same does not just apply to Islamic countries, it also applies to Hamas (Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya) which uses the civilian population of Gazans to materialize their hatred for Jews.Notably, Hamas has been using civilian sites like hospitals, religious sites, or educational institutions to launch rocket or missile attacks and exploit civilians as cannon fodder. The Israeli Defence Forces demonstrated an example of a religious site that was hit by the Israeli Air Force as it was used by Hamas to launch a terror attack on Israel.Israeli civilians are not Hamas’ only victim.Hamas intentionally positions itself deep among Gaza's population. For example…this terrorist site that the Israel Air Force targeted, located next to a mosque and just a football field away from a school. pic.twitter.com/ROs3iMdnLzThe Rafah Border Crossing, also known as the Rafah Crossing Point, serves as the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. It is located on the Gaza–Egypt border, which was recognised by the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty. However, Egypt has a long history of prohibiting Gazan refugees from entering its territory to avoid its negative security implications. Cairo which has suffered the brunt of Islamic State (IS) or Daesh, has feared infiltration of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Palestinians, particularly Gazan refugees. Even today, soon after the Hamas terrorists imposed an unprovoked war on Israel, Egyptian security closed this sole border crossing for Gazans. The reports of it were confirmed by the Israeli officials who had earlier asked the Gazans to cross over to Egypt in the wake of its retaliatory strikes on Hamas terror sites. However, later they had to clarify that the Rafah crossing was open yesterday, but now it is closed.BREAKING: Egypt has closed the Rafah crossing with Gaza's southern borderThe Rafah border crossing has remained predominantly closed since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007. Even when Egypt makes some concessions, it only allows those who require medical treatment or have foreign residency permits to cross the borders, a move targeted toward Hamas terrorists. Do you know why #Egypt doesn't open the #Rafah border crossing with #Gaza to let 2.3 million Palestinians living there flee? This is because 8 out of every 10 Palestinian men living in #Gaza are terrorists or terrorism supporters! For years, Egypt has suffered from #ISIL/#Daesh,… pic.twitter.com/zD0C89d7pAStrikingly, the Egyptian fear revolving around the entry of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Gazan refugees stems from the fact that Hamas has in the past targeted the Rafah border and Egyptian border personnel including blowing it up with explosives. One such incident was reported on 23 January 2008, when Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah border crossing, destroying part of the 2003 wall.Meanwhile, Israel had already sealed its border crossings with the Palestinian enclave, allowing in only humanitarian aid and basic supplies which have been cut post the 7th October Hamas terrorist attack on Israeli citizens.Earlier, Hamas used to amass funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Notably, Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south and Rafah is the sole border crossing. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is again a dreaded and designated terrorist organisation.  Afterward, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Recently, Jordan implemented a policy that can’t be further from the concept of “Common brotherhood” or the antithesis of catering to the Ummah brotherhood. Evidently, Jordan which was perceived as a host accepting millions of Palestinian, Iraqi, and Syrian refugees on the lines of the Universal Muslim Brotherhood, had taken a hard turn. Experts have pointed out that the “Jordan Initiative” unveiled in May will radically change Jordan from one of the world’s most accommodating hosts to one of its biggest proponents for sending refugees home. Regarding this, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch, Adam Coogle said, “Jordan long has said that refugees are welcome. But now the official rhetoric has moved toward supporting their return. It’s a cause for significant concern.”Similarly, Lebanon and Turkey have speeded up the deportation of hundreds of Syrians, their Muslim brethren, since April to speed up their exodus from their so-called “pro-Ummah” nation.  Likewise, Pakistan, the vociferous proponent of Ummah, has recently asked millions of Afghan refugees to leave the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Afghan refugees who had fled their nation when the Taliban took over Kabul and had been living in Pakistan have been reportedly given only four weeks time to return, forcing them to choose between the brutalities of two co-religionist nations, Pakistan or Afghanistan.  On the basis of Ummah, persecuted Muslim citizens/refugees of war-torn Yemen should have garnered the same support as they have been suffering from a brutal war, starvation, and cholera that have been ruining lives. However, this is not the case because co-religionists are involved in this war and there is no “convenience of victimhood” involved in the Yemeni conflict to furtherance the cause of Dar-ul-Islam or fighting/killing the infidel. There is a war in Yemen, there is a war in Syria, there is a war in Sudan, and there is a war in Lybia. Muslims are killing Muslims in all these wars, thousands of victims, did you see any protests in New York, London, Berlin, ..? Why?Because for many Muslims they do not really…The same goes for Syrian, Sudanese, and Libyan refugees, Muslims being persecuted by terrorism in Africa and elsewhere, attract no whispers of support as they don’t have the binding clue – common enemy. Islamic nations like Pakistan, Iran, Turkiye, Palestine, Lebanon, etc have committed sins on their own native Muslim sects – Ahmediyas, Balochs, and Sindhis etc in Pakistan, Hamas killing dissenting Muslims and Fatah leadership, etc. Fighting for common brotherhood, persecuted Muslims and atrocities, and ethnic cleansing in Muslim countries by Muslim leadership have always been brushed under the carpet.     Instead, the outcry for atrocities is targeted at non-believers for causing hindrance to their dehumanising and Jihadi acts –reflected in the anti-Semitic, anti-Hindu, anti-Western (Christ-believing countries) calls, like “Gas the Jews”, asking Pakistanis to kill ‘Hindus’, death to Israel and “death to America” in the Iranian parliament.  Palestinian Islamic Scholar Nidhal Siam's Anti Hindu speechAnd they're Supporting Palestine pic.twitter.com/fdsQQGgs0hThe latest hatred towards the “common enemy” is clear from the fact that the Arab world has refrained from condemning the propensity of crime committed on innocent Israeli citizens. On 7th October, Hamas terrorists launched a war involving rocket barrages and ground invasion into Israeli territories killing unsuspecting Israelis and other foreign nationals present in their sight. In the catastrophic invasion of Israel, more than 700 Israeli citizens have lost their lives, hundreds of children, girls, and the elderly have been taken hostage with Hamas terrorists giving open threats to behead them and air the beheadings, rape being used as weapons of war, bared and bruised bodies of women being paraded in streets. Conspicuously, these assaults were inflicted on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians. Be it Australia or Canada, the UK or the USA, the Palestinian cause has seen overwhelming support. However, the same people have never stood for the millions of malnourished children in Yemen, they never cared for the little girls deprived of schooling in Afghanistan, or the Muslims victimized by terrorists in Africa. The global Muslim population conspicuously lacks concerns for legitimate human rights abuses and atrocities when the perpetrators are their own people. It only unites when the enemy is the “other”, the Jew, the Hindu, or the Christian. Simply put, they just want to see the end of non-believers, one excruciating death after another and Jews had always been the first in line followed by Hindus and Christians with rejected/outcasted Muslim sects like Ahmediyas in between. Iran’s fanatism to have nuclear power demonstrates that it just wants to destroy the Jewish state and to achieve that it is ready to spend dozens of Gazas and Palestinians and Lebanon etc. The first hallucination of the usage of nuclear arsenal will be on Israel, taking away the existence of their beloved Palestinian Muslim brethren, for whom such wars are claimed to be fought for and such brutality are being justified.    Meanwhile, in the non-Arab world, leaders from across the world, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden have expressed their solidarity and support for Israel at its difficult hour. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Common victimhood has become a tool, while common brotherhood is just a blatant lie, the only thing that unites the Muslim world, in general, is the hatred of the ‘common enemy’ – Israel, followed by Hindus and Christians with outcasted Muslim sects in between.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

34,"6 October, 2023 ",The Hindu and how it is creating the North-South Divide: Repeatedly lying about devolution of funds and cheating their readers with misinformation," Instead of focusing on meaningful criticism, our English media has now been reduced to repeatedly lying and cheating their readers. It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too. Thankfully, the citizens of our country are much more intelligent than these hate-mongers in the English media. The Hindu published an article on 5th October 2023, with a very combative headline – “Retribution for the South, accolade for the North”. I think you got the gist just by looking at the headline. This article was a continuation of the oft-repeated argument by this ilk, that South India is superior to North India and yet the Government of India keeps rewarding North India and ignores South India.This particular article discusses the divisive argument through two subjects – the Delimitation of Lok Sabha Constituencies and the devolution of funds through Finance Commissions. While discussing these two subjects, the article stands out for some really unique arguments. The first is how it changes our understanding of basic geography itself. Sample this core argument at the beginning of the article:The authors, one of whom is a professor, have miraculously decided that the Gujarati-speaking Western state of Gujarat is actually a Hindi-speaking Northern State for the sake of their argument. I kept on thinking as to why they would make this fundamental error. Is it to bolster their argument that the 4% increase in population in a certain group of states is because of Gujarat? Turns out, it is not. Even if Gujarat is not included in this elite list, the core argument (a 4% increase in population share) will stay as strong. This is not the first time this ilk has tried to alter our fundamental understanding of Geography. Prashant Kishor, in an interview with Shekhar Gupta, enlightens us that “Hindi heartland has now extended to Western India in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka”. How does Karnataka remotely get classified as a “Hindi heartland” and more importantly a “Western state”? How do Gujarat and Maharashtra get into the bracket of “Hindi heartland” when crores of people in these states speak and take pride in their own languages? Can you imagine if powerful commentators (such as Shekhar Gupta) and publications (such as The Hindu) could lie like this in today’s day and age, what must they have done back then when they were even more powerful? It is perplexing that they think their reader will not see through this chicanery. This bogey of labelling random states as “Hindi speaking” and altering their geography, merely because they vote for the BJP is really a sad reflection of the mental state of these commentators. But why exactly are they altering the fundamentals of geography like this? The essence is captured in these two paragraphs – South Indian states will lose out on their share of representation in the Lok Sabha post delimitation. Recently, India Today also put up a graphic on their website giving out some numbers on how South’s representation will come down if population is the criteria. This was dutifully picked up by the divisive politicians from the South. All of them are making one fundamental assumption that the number of Lok Sabha seats will remain constant at 543. It has been discussed at various forums that the number of Lok Sabha seats will increase from the current 543. It doesn’t make sense for us to have the same number of seats when our population was 50 crores versus when it is 140 crores! The new Lok Sabha building can accommodate 888 MPs – surely, they have built it with the purpose of increasing the seats from the existing 545. Instead of telling the readers about these possibilities, the English media is purposely fomenting hatred by discussing only one remote possibility.  Now, the authors of The Hindu could not fill up enough space with only one bogus argument, so they decided to repeat the lie about the devolution of funds through the 15th Finance Commission (FC). The core argument is just in one paragraph highlighted below:From 1975 till 2015, all finance commissions (7th to 13th) took the 1971 census as a reference. You must actually be wondering what relevance would the 1971 census have in 2015. This statistic actually reflects the status quoist mindset of the Congress party. But we digress. The Modi government did the logical thing of mandating to partial use the latest 2011 census data from 2015-2020 (14th FC) and fully use it from 2020 onwards (15th FC). Ever since this gang started screaming that the South States “lost the advantage despite doing good on population control. Controversial website Wire even went to the extent of claiming that “It is becoming almost untenable for Tamil Nadu and Kerala to thrive in the Indian union as rational, self-interested sub-units.”On peripheral reading, you would actually think that this is a logical argument and be wondering why I am being so banal about it. In fact, if you read the article snippet pasted above from The Hindu, you would also assume that the Modi government hasn’t incorporated this logical argument at all, and is, therefore, anti-South India, fascist and whatnot. Guess what? The 15th Finance Commission has reduced the weightage allotted to only the population and has added a new criterion to actually reward states that have done well on controlling the population. Take a look at the comparison table below (the highlighted portion indicates the new criteria).Demographic Performance refers to how states have performed with respect to population control. Simply put, you will be rewarded if you control your population better – which is exactly what the article in The Hindu is arguing for! The “tax effort” incentivizes states that have done well in tax collection efforts. This parameter is back in the 15th FC (after not being considered in the previous 3 FCs). The moot question therefore is this – Why have the authors of The Hindu piece intentionally not told the readers about this most important piece of information? Why have the editors published this lie-filled article when the fundamental premise itself has no basis? What do these people gain by fomenting such hate between regions of India? If anything, the Narendra Modi government has revolutionized the manner in which funds are devolved to the states. The states used to get 32% of the central share until the 13th FC period (ends 2015). From 2015 onwards, the states got a whopping 41% share. The percentage increase in the share is one aspect. Because of buoyant tax collections, as part of this 41% share, the states received a whopping 69.60 lakh crores (2014 to 2023) as opposed to just 18.50 lakh crores in the 2004 to 2014 period. Instead of focusing on meaningful criticism, our English media has now been reduced to repeatedly lying and cheating their readers. It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too. Thankfully, the citizens of our country are much more intelligent than these hate-mongers in the English media. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

35,"4 October, 2023 ","From KCR’s offer to join NDA to Tribal Uni, a promise made by UPA: Two Telangana visits, explosive revelations by PM Modi will change the political game"," No one in Telangana was ready for the political bombshells or the administrative surprises. It is now up to the state BJP unit to take this message forward. Will these get converted to votes? Time will only tell! Even by Prime Minister Modi’s hectic travel standards, it is unlikely that he will visit the same state in a span of 3 days. So, when his itinerary was announced for his visits to Telangana on October 1st and 3rd, it certainly created excitement amongst the cadre and inquisitiveness among the media. And true to the expectations, Prime Minister Modi made some explosive revelations and announced some critical projects that are bound to change the nature of discourse in Telangana politics. On October 3rd, Prime Minister Modi revealed that Chief Minister KCR had approached him, after BRS’s loss in GHMC elections in the year 2020, with an offer to join the NDA in exchange for support in the GHMC council. He has also asked the media to check out the dates to validate his claim (the dates do check out. The results were declared on December 5th, and KCR met Modi on Dec. 12th). This offer was rejected by the Prime Minister and the BJP chose to sit in the opposition. Prime Minister Modi has also told us that KCR informed him that he plans to make KTR the CM and wanted Modi’s blessings for the same. The timing of this revelation also checks out because there were multiple leaks to the media in January 2021 that the coronation of KTR is right around the corner. The idea had to be dropped by KCR owing to severe resistance from within the party and his extended family too. The Prime Minister’s revelations have to be seen in the context of the growing narrative in the state that the BRS and BJP are friends and not foes! The mind really boggles at how the Congress party was very successful in spreading this narrative. The chief reason being cited was that despite multiple interrogations by the ED, KCR’s daughter Kavitha has not been arrested yet in the now famous Delhi Liquor Scam. The ED chargesheet does talk about a “South Group” of which Kavitha is a part, that arranged for 100 crores in bribes in exchange for licenses. The BJP cadre was finding it very difficult to counter this argument. And around the same time, the popular and vociferous BJP President Bandi Sanjay Kumar was replaced – thus adding more fuel to the narrative that this was done at the behest of a BRS-BJP understanding! The Prime Minister’s revelations have certainly come as a boost for the party cadre, but his announcements on October 1st in Telangana were no less significant and were equally narrative-setting in nature. Until the year 2021, Telangana was the highest turmeric-producing state in India. The people of Nizamabad district had a demand for nearly 15 years that a Turmeric board be set up in Nizamabad so that the turmeric farmers here get better opportunities and rates to sell Turmeric. There is this farmer who took a vow in the year 2011 that he will walk barefoot till the Turmeric Board is set up in Nizamabad. KCR’s daughter, Kavitha fought the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Nizamabad promising them that she will bring the Turmeric board. She failed to do so (among her many failures) and she eventually lost the 2019 election to BJP’s Dharmapuri Arvind.D. Arvind signed a bond paper to the people of Nizamabad that he would resign if he failed to bring the Turmeric Board and also a good MSP for Turmeric. Though the central government announced the setting up of a Spices Board regional office in Nizamabad, it didn’t cut any ice with the voters. As has been the trend with the Modi government, where long pending issues are resolved quickly, Prime Minister Modi has announced on October 1st, the setting up of the National Turmeric Board in Nizamabad. This took the BRS by surprise because they were all busy making jokes about how Arvind failed to get the Turmeric board and how his bond paper was now a joke. With this announcement, one of the key demands of thousands of farmers in Nizamabad stands fulfilled. In fact, the setting up of a Turmeric board in general has been a demand even in the states of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. This is the first time in 36 years that a board is being set up specifically for a product. The second major announcement was of setting up a Central Tribal University in Telangana. You may be wondering what is so major about setting up a university. This university was promised in the AP Reorganisation Act of 2014 bought by the UPA. Despite swift approvals from the Modi government, the BRS government delayed land acquisition. And yet BRS started shouting from the rooftops that it is the Modi government that is doing grave injustice to Telangana by not granting the university! After 9 years of dilly-dallying by the KCR government (nicely captured in this thread), the Central Tribal University has finally become a reality. The Prime Minister had to make repeated mentions of the Congress party (both in his speeches and tweets) in these two days because it was important to remind people of the corrupt and inept Congress party. These steps were necessitated also because of both the stagnating fortunes of the BJP and the rise of the Congress in Telangana. No one in Telangana was ready for the political bombshells or the administrative surprises. It is now up to the state BJP unit to take this message forward. Will these get converted to votes? Time will only tell! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

36,"2 October, 2023 ","Son of a Congress leader, Fareed Zakaria, who had called for foreign interference in India, now whitewashes Khalistani terrorist Nijjar"," While explaining to his audience why India was accusing Canada of providing a safe haven to terrorists, he downplays the Khalistani terrorism in the name of a separate homeland, ‘Khalistan’. On Monday (October 2), CNN released an episode of India-born US journalist Fareed Zakaria pontificating on the diplomatic row between India and Canada following Justin Trudeau’s absurd allegations against New Delhi. In the 5-minute video, the son of Former Congress Minister Rafiq Zakaria, Fareed Zakaria goes on at length to whitewash Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. He trivialises the real threat of Khalistani terrorism by casting aspersions over the authenticity and gravity of the danger they pose to India’s national security and the lives of patriotic Indians inside and outside India.  Today’s last look: why Trudeau’s startling allegations are playing out very differently in Modi’s India pic.twitter.com/brVKd0QjzoZakaria also accused India of indulging in jingoism over the Canadian allegation and implies that the Khalistani terrorism issue is being exaggerated for political gains by PM Modi and BJP in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections in 2024. Zakaria begins by quoting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, where he had accused India of being involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil. He then goes on to whitewash Hardeep Singh Nijjar by briefly describing him as a Sikh “activist” and head of a Sikh temple (Gurudwara) and tries to say that he was gunned down by unidentified assailants in June in the temple’s parking lot. Zakaria sidestepped the fact that Nijjar had an Interpol arrest warrant against his name as early as November 2014 for being involved in serious offenses like murder, among a host of other illegal activities. Zakaria deliberately omits the fact that Trudeau was pandering to Khalistani terrorists by raising the issue of Khalistani terrorist Nijjar’s killing with India for political reasons. While giving a political spin to India’s response to the issue, he didn’t mention the alliance between the NDP and the Liberal party. Jagmeet Singh’s NDP is a known party of Khalistani sympathisers in India.Instead, he presented Trudeau’s absurd allegations against India as a move to get Justice for Nijjar. He claimed that the motive of Justin Trudeau in making these allegations was to shame the Indian government by airing these allegations publicly and compel it to cooperate in the investigation.  In fact, he had earlier given a call to the US government to directly interfere in India’s internal affairs. He advocated for (the US govt) to ally with India’s businesses, press, NGOs, and cultural groups, indirectly hinting that the US government should invest in regime change tactics instead of seeking healthy bilateral relations with India. Back then, he had also targeted India for focusing on its own national interest insinuating that the ideal ally of the US should prioritise US interests above its own interests.Later in the video, he delves into, “why Trudeau’s startling allegations are playing out very differently in Modi’s India”. Citing some snippets from Indian media and political analysts, he laments that these stories have “released a spasm of Jingoism”. He then goes on to paint a contrasting picture of Canada as seen from a Western lens vis-a-vis how India has started to portray Canada as – “a safe haven for terrorists.”  In the video, Zakaria states, “In India, the reactions are very different and reveal in fact that Justin Trudeau blew it. Just look at the Indian press, the story has released a spasm of Jingoism in which TV anchors cast Canada not as a multicultural haven and stable democracy, you and I may know but as a rogue state bent on protecting terrorists.” To highlight this point, he plays the clip of Arnab Goswami where he referred to Justin Trudeau as a supporter of terrorism, an open terror backer, and a terrorist sympathiser and added that he is at the point of no return. Zakaria argues that political analyst Sushant Sareen has aptly described the Country’s reaction, “if we did it, it was right, if we didn’t do it, you are wrong.” If we did it, it was right; if we didn’t, you were wrong https://t.co/0btTVWeAlDArguing that with this case, India is misrepresenting itself as a victim of Western bullying on the domestic front, Zakaria added, “An analysis peace of the Hindustan Times conjures up memories of Western colonial powers ganging up against India claiming that Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s killing will be a rallying point for the Anglo-Saxon bloc to come together against India.”  While explaining to his audience why India was accusing Canada of providing a safe haven to terrorists, he downplays the Khalistani terrorism in the name of a separate homeland, ‘Khalistan’. He blatantly lies by mainstreaming the fringe Khalistanis by claiming that Nijjar was one among many foreign-based Sikhs who advocate for Khalistan.    Regarding this, he said, “Indian officials have accused Canada of providing a safe haven for terrorists, that might sound like a puzzling and absurd allegation but it is a reference to the fact that Nijjar was a Sikh separatist. One of many Sikhs abroad who advocate for a separate country for Sikhs, the homeland they want to create, Khalistan, the idea that goes back decades, the efforts include armed militancy in India that peaked in the 1980s.”  Subsequently, he whitewashes the ongoing crimes and public calls for violence against Hindus by Khalistani elements. For this, he mischievously downplays by quoting The Economist which claimed that Khalistan is merely an “idle talking point” in the Sikh diaspora.    He said, “As the Economist notes, the movement for Khalistan was responsible for the death of thousands in the 1980s and 1990s but has since been little more than an idle talking point in the Sikh diaspora and has negligible support in India.”Casting aspersions on India’s concern regarding national security and the lives of Indian nationals abroad, Fareed Zakaria goes on to say that Canada catering to India’s demand to act tough on Khalistani elements would be “politically useful” for PM Modi and BJP.  He said, “Whatever the reality in this one case, tensions between India and Canada over “Sikh activists” in the Indian diaspora have been long-running. As the FT notes, India’s accusations that Canada has been too soft on “Sikh activists” deserve some scrutiny. But it is also true that playing up this kind of threat to India is politically useful for PM Narendra Modi and his party BJP.”  Citing the example of the Pulwama terror attack and subsequent response by India, he argues that Trudeau’s strategy to seek justice by naming and shaming India is fundamentally flawed. Painting ‘Hindu Nationalism’ as anti-minority and anti-West, he sermonises, “You see Justin Trudeau’s whole strategy of naming and shaming India fundamentally misunderstands the dynamics of Modi’s Hindu nationalism which is rooted in the belief that India’s Hindu majority has been passive for too long in the face of minorities and foreigners. When presented with an opportunity, Modi knows how to translate it into political gold.”  He continued, “In 2019 a suicide bomber carried out the worst attack in decades killing dozens of Indian soldiers, India blamed Pakistan militants and sent in the Indian Airforce and carried out strikes on what it said was a militant training facility in Pakistan. Though Pakistan denied the strikes hit much of anything. Nonetheless, it was the first time that such a cross-border operation had been carried out in almost fifty years.”  Connecting the dots of then vs. now, and indirectly underscoring the fact that Canada is becoming new Pakistan for India, Zakaria concluded by lamenting that this portrayal that Modi is standing against Sikh separatism and Western bullying will be an election plank for him, regardless that it might not be real or dangerous.  Fareed Zakaria ranted, “As Bloomberg noted, Modi went on a victory lap, saying in a campaign speech that he believed in barging into the house of terrorists and killing them. He implied without any evidence that the opposition parties’ sympathies lay with the terrorists. Pollsters reported a boost in Modi’s approval ratings after the strike. Now Modi faces another election, and he will surely be helped if he can run by standing against Sikh separatism and Western bullying, regardless of how real or dangerous either threat actually is.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

37,"13 October, 2023 ",Did a Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire while burning the Israeli flag? Know the truth behind the video which has gone viral," The video is an old one from 2021 and the incident happened during the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran in May that year.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in mass genocide, killing over 1300 Israelis and injuring hundreds more. As the Israel-Hamas war rages, a video went viral which showed a man unintentionally lighting himself on fire while burning an Israeli flag.The video has been widely shared on X since yesterday (October 12), with most of the users alleging that it was a Hamas supporter who attempted to burn the Israeli flag amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. They mocked the Hamas supporter saying that Karma paid him back. An X user @Hariindic shared the video with the caption, “Look at the current situation of Hamas – Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire! Karma works wonders.”#Hamas situation right now😂🇮🇱🇵🇸 WATCH: Hamas supporter accidentally sets himself on fire! Karma acts in wonderful ways.#Israel #IsraelPalestineWar #HamasMassacre #GazaUnderAttack #HamasTerrorism #Gaza_under_attack #HamasTerrorists #Palestine #GazaUnderAttack #Gaza pic.twitter.com/4pNnGgG6CbIn the footage, a man is seen holding a massive Israeli flag. Another man approached the man who was holding the flag and set it on fire. Within seconds, due to the direction of the wind, the clothes of the man who is holding the flag also catch fire. The man immediately drops the flag on the ground and scampers away after his clothes catch fire. Amusingly, the group of protestors who were seen standing beside him holding Palestinian flags, instead of coming to his rescue, quickly moved away from him to save themselves from the fire.Though the video was being shared extensively on X, formally Twitter, OpIndia decided to do some investigation, after which we learned that the video was an old one that resurfaced in the midst of the recent Israel-Hamas confrontation. Even in 2021, the same video was shared by numerous social media accounts. The majority of these accounts belonged to Muslim people who had posted the video to express their hostility towards Israelis.خداوندا مارا از دست پیروانت نجات بده.God, save us from your followers pic.twitter.com/T3xGT5ImJyIn fact, the Times of Israel reported about the incident in May 2021. The media report shared the same video posted by several X users then, claiming that the video was from the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran on May 7 2021.Let us inform you that in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution, Iran established Al-Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day. The Iranian government marks the day with anti-Israel rallies, demonstrations, and threats to “liberate” Jerusalem from Israeli rule.In conclusion, despite the fact that the video has recently gone viral amid the ongoing Israel and Hamas war, it is an old one from Iran and does not feature any Hamas supporters or terrorists. Though here too, the Israeli flag was burnt in a show of sympathy for Palestine and a show of anger against Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

38,"7 October, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did 121 people die because of the shutting down of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi," Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. Days after the Allahabad High Court stayed the suspension on the licence of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi, social media was rife with disinformation about the death of 121 people in the Munshiganj area of the city.On Friday (6th October), a propaganda news outlet by the name of ‘4 pm’ interviewed an alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, who made outrageous claims about the death of 121 patients due to lack of medical attention.An alleged nursing staffer by the name of Saurabh Mishra claimed that a whopping 121 residents of Amethi died due to the closure of the hospital. “Some are dying en route to Lucknow, others are not getting medicines on time. There are not even cotton swabs and bandages,” he claimed “Around 121 patients have died in just 15 days,” Mishra continued. “This is the politics of vengeance…They (BJP) hate Gandhis,” he brazened out. Prior to him, another alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital named Umashankar Pandey claimed that the licence of the medical facility was suspended due to the BJP’s disdain for the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.“Smriti Irani (MP from Amethi constituency) hates the fact that ‘Gandhi’ name is attached to the hospital. Now, they (BJP) are hurting the employability of small-time workers,” he was heard as saying. After the clips of the video went viral online, the Congress system exploited the opportunity to create hysteria about the supposed death of more than 120 people in Amethi.It must be mentioned that the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi is run by the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Trust (SGMT), which is headed by Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi.Congress loyalist Shantanu claimed, “In hate of Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family, @smritiirani and the BJP govt of Uttar Pradesh took lives of 121 people as the functioning of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital was stopped…” He later deleted his tweet.flesh alive passed the sell by date.The max sucking power of her throat and lungs it's all down hill from here,1.6 B Indian slaves being treated like animals.Shame on dirty Indian politics/politicians.Feku &Gang should be hanged, not worth living on planet earth.Sooner the betterOther propaganda artists also shared the claims about the death of 121 patients. On Friday (6th October) night, the District Magistrate & Collector of Amethi, Rakesh Kumar Mishra, rubbished the false claims being propagated on social media.एकदम भ्रामक एवं गलत बात कही जा रही है। किसी की मृत्यु नहीं हुई हैं। जनपद अमेठी के सभी सरकारी चिकित्सालयों में दवा आदि की कोई कमी नहीं है। तथ्य के विपरीत जनस्वास्थ्य के बारे में अफवाह फैलाने के विरूद्ध वैधानिक कार्यवाही की जाएगी ।“Completely misleading and wrong things are being shared. No one has died. There is no shortage of medicines in any government hospital of Amethi district,” he informed. “Legal action will be taken against spreading rumours about public health contrary to facts,” the District Magistrate of Amethi warned.Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. The victim went into a state of coma after being administered anaesthesia, prior to a kidney stone operation.Shukla was then referred to Medanta Hospital in Lucknow, where she eventually passed away. The district administration ordered the closure of the hospital, citing medical negligence, and directed the suspension of OPD and emergency services. A case was also registered against 4 employees of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital for negligence. On Wednesday (4th October), the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court put the order of the district administration on hold and directed the resumption of services.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

39,"25 September, 2023 ",‘Kapil Dev kidnapped or Harsh Bhogle-type promotional stunt?’ See how Netizens react to a viral video showing goons taking him away," As soon as the video went viral, netizens started flooding Gautam Gambhir's timeline hoping that it was a promotional stunt similar to what happened last year with cricket pundit Harsha BhogleOn Monday, September 25, a 0.07-second video clip took the internet by storm. The video which quickly went viral showed a person resembling cricket legend Kapil Dev, who had his hands tied and mouth strapped being manhandled and taken away by two goons. Cricketer turned politician Gautam Gambhir shared the clip on X, formally Twitter as he enquired about the World Cup-winning captain’s well-being. However, as soon as the video went viral, netizens started flooding Gautam Gambhir’s timeline hoping that it was a promotional stunt similar to what happened last year with cricket pundit Harsha Bhogle.Sharing the video Gautam Gambhir wrote, “Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev and that Kapil Paaji is fine!” along with a fingers-crossed emoji.Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev 🤞and that Kapil Paaji is fine! pic.twitter.com/KsIV33DbmpIn the 0.07-second clip, a man in a light blue t-shirt and checkered trousers is seen being carried away by two goons. The man, who resembles Kapil Dev, has his wrists tied behind him and his mouth strapped with a piece of cloth. The man turns around for a fraction of a second, revealing his face. He offers a helpless look as the two men drag him inside a dingy house.While no official statement has been issued regarding the viral video, numerous followers on social media have claimed that it is nothing more than a promotional gimmick. Advertisment lol😅😅No one falls for it nowMany Netizens reacted angrily, slamming the ad firm for the lame video and praying and hoping for the cricket legend’s well-being and safety. These ex cricketers are selling themselves for ad money. Some are selling gutkhas while others are doing these cheap ads. ShameSeeing Kapil Dev kidnapped in a viral clip is worrying every cricket fan. Hoping it's fictional, not real crime. If just an attention-grabbing ad, the creators should apologize for causing such distress irresponsibly.#KapilDev #ResponsibleMarketing https://t.co/WwmRLauk1pDisgusting way for viewership, atleast respect our legends 👍Some were quick to recall a video from last year that showed cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle abruptly disappearing while speaking to a sports portal via video link. Just as it was eventually revealed that Harsha Bhogle’s video was a promotional gimmick, many Netizens were convinced that this was a re-run of last year’s act.It looks like an ad.. Hopefully it is They did this earlier with Harsha too.A similar video that had left Netizens worrying, had emerged in March 2022, wherein cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle suddenly disappeared while talking to a sports portal via video link. Harsha Bhogle was talking to cricketsportwalkin on an Instagram live session on March 24, 2022, when suddenly he disappeared from the screen after the camera apparently fell to the ground with a blurry image. However, later it was revealed that it was a promotional stunt that went wrong, as people started genuinely worrying about him.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

40,"24 September, 2023 ",Fact Check: TMC leader Kirti Azad passes off old photo of BJP workers as ‘Sanghis protesting against Canada outside Canara Bank’," In October 2022, Kirti Azad shared a fake quote attributed to RSS leader MS Golwalkar on Twitter, which claimed that he was willing to tolerate British subjugation but not a government that granted Muslims and Dalits equal status.On Sunday (September 24), Trinamool Congress leader Kirti Azad courted controversy after he falsely claimed that BJP workers mistook Canara Bank for Canada and had been protesting outsides its premises.In a tweet (archive), the 64-year-old politician wrote, “BJP Sanghis assumed Canara Bank to be Canada and held demonstrations in front of the bank’s building.” The tweet was accompanied by a picture of a group of people, standing outside Canara Bank with BJP flags in hand.At the time of writing, the contentious tweet had more than 2000 likes and 500 retweets. The former cricketer-turned-politician sought to exploit the ongoing diplomatic tension between India and Canada to score political brownies.A quick ‘reverse Google image search’ of the image led us to a news report, published by Tamil daily ‘Maalai Malar’. The said report was published on August 30, 2020 i.e. 3 years ago.At the very onset, it became clear that the picture shared by Kirti Azad had nothing to do with the ongoing diplomatic standoff between India and Canada. The Maalai Malar report stated that BJP workers held demonstrations in Ooty against the city administration for removing a flagpole, which was installed to hoist the party flag. The municipality had alleged that no prior permission was sought from them by the BJP. Thus, it clearly shows that the BJP workers were not protesting against Canada in any form or manner. It is also interesting to note that the original picture was photoshopped with another image of Canara Bank by Kirti Azad to lend credence to his dubious claims.This is however not the first time that Kirti Azad has resorted to peddling fake news on social media. Earlier in February 2022, he falsely claimed that BJP leaders were being thrashed by the common people during the second phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh. In reality, the video is not from Uttar Pradesh but from the State of West Bengal. The victim in the incident was BJP leader Anirban Ganguly, who informed that he was attacked by Trinamool Congress-sponsored Jihadis. Hi Kirti, amusing to see that you,Bhagwat Jha Azad’s son,can’t distinguish between the hinterlands of #WestBengal & #UttarPradesh!This is clip of a jihadi attack engineered by TMC on me on Election Day, April 30 2021.Having become a FAMILY DOORMAT you have lost your rationality! https://t.co/qfkH1XGlV4In October 2022, Kirti Azad shared a fake quote attributed to RSS leader MS Golwalkar on Twitter, which claimed that he was willing to tolerate British subjugation but not a government in the nation that granted Muslims and Dalits equal status.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

In this story, The New York Times called Hamas ‘terrorists’. However, it replaced the word ‘terrorists’ with ‘gunmen’ after some time, in line with the left-liberal media policy of not using the term terrorist for jihadi terrorists.The news article titled ‘Hamas Leaves Trail of Terror in Israel’ was published on 10th October by The New York Times. In the subtitle of the article, the American newspaper wrote, “As Israeli soldiers regain control of areas near Gaza that came under attack, they are finding evidence seen in videos and photos and confirmed by witness accounts of the massacre of civilians by Hamas terrorists.”After some time, The New York Times changed the last word in the sentence ‘terrorist’ to ‘gunmen’. The NYT was called out on social media for calling terrorists just gunmen in order to score Islamoapologetic secular credentials. American journalist Greg Price wrote, “Holy shit you can’t make this up. The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen”.” Greg Price also shared the screenshots of the news before and after the change.The archive of the report shows the term ‘terrorist’ used by NYT before it was replaced.🚨Holy shit you can’t make this up.The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen.” pic.twitter.com/zp7vQUrHn3Interestingly, while the original report used the term ‘terrorist’ in the subtitle, it was used only once in the report, while the word ‘gunmen’ was used throughout the report. The publication has not replaced the lone occurrence of the term terrorist in the report, which appears in the second paragraph. The word ‘gunmen’ appears 8 times in the report text, sometimes called ‘Palestinian gunmen’ or ‘Hamas gunmen’. There is no mention in the report that Hamas also fired over 5,000 rockets into Israel, many of which hit civilian areas after overwhelming Israel’s air defence system Iron Dome.Referring to the 9/11 terrorist attack in the USA, Greg Price also wrote, “Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.”Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.Another X user with handle ID @WithRitesh posted, “Learning from their brothers across Atlantic!

I am glad they are slowly, but surely, going the way of the newspaper.” He also added a screenshot of news by the Washington Post calling ISIS terrorist Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi an ‘austere religious scholar’. The words used for the ISIS terrorist were later changed to ‘extremist leader’ after the news outlet faced criticism.Our media is contemptible and morally bankrupt.

It has repeatedly provided a platform for Islamic bigotry. In April 2021, NYT published a news article that said that the onus to convert is on non-Muslims in case of an interfaith marriage involving a Muslim and a non-Muslim.The New York Times is also notorious for its anti-India anti-Modi agenda. In March 2023, the New York Times published an article written by Anuradha Bhasin, the Executive Editor of The Kashmir Times who criticized PM Modi’s stance against the Indian media and its freedom of expression. Donning an anti-India outlook on the international media platform, she alleged that the Modi-led government had imposed ‘repressive’ media policies in the country and was deliberately targeting the media organizations who chose to voice an opinion against it or the Prime Minister.The Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Youth Affairs, and Sports Anurag Thakur lashed out at the New York Times for this anti-India editorial published on 8th March 2023. Anurag Thakur had said, “We don’t need to learn the grammar of democracy from agenda-driven media.” Now, The New York Times has called the Hamas terrorists as gunmen. The recent Israel-Hamas war started after the State of Israel came under attack by Palestine-based Islamic terror outfit Hamas on Saturday (7th October), resulting in the death of more than 900 Israelis. About 2400 people have been wounded and over 100 still remain in the captivity of the terrorists. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Who is the terrorist in this case? There is another question – Who is the victim?”, he resorted to shielding the Palestine-based Islamist terror organisation Hamas.The former NDTV ‘journalist’ suggested that Israel could not be a victim of terror in the ongoing conflict as several powerful Western nations are supporting the Jewish State. Ravish shamelessly defends Hamas TerroristsAsks who is Real Terrorist- Hamas or Israel?Attacks countries supporting Israel of siding with Terrorists.""हमास और इज़राइल में किसके आतंकवाद की निंदा होनी चाहिए?”""बड़े देश शक्तिशाली इज़राइल का समर्थन कर आतंक का साथ दे रहे हैं” pic.twitter.com/F4bauFaBN8“We have seen an interesting nomenclature in several writings – one is being called a victim (aka Palestine) and another is dubbed as the victim of victims (aka Israel)… Both of them are accused of terrorism and both are victims…Powerful Israel, accused of occupation (in Gaza) is also a victim,” Ravish Kumar claimed. The former ‘scribe’ made a case for Hamas by claiming that the terror organisation in Palestine is not as ‘powerful’ as Israel. “Now imagine the flight of those who are weak (in front of Israel)…Most nations are with Israel and it is still the victim of ‘victims.’ Not even a handful of countries are with Palestine,” he brazened out.In a bid to pacify his large follower base of Hamas sympathisers, Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these countries doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”“एक महीना पहले, नेतन्याहू को जनता का समर्थन नहीं था।सवाल पूछा जाना चाहिए कि हमास अंदर कैसे आ गया, और इसका जवाब इज़राइल के जवाब में मिलेगा”रवीश घूमा-फिरा के बता रहे हैं कि हमला करवा कर नेतन्याहू अपनी सरकार बचा रहे।सिर्फ रवीश ऐसी घटिया सोच रख सकता। pic.twitter.com/1oWiFlBb0RLater in his monologue, the YouTuber insinuated that the Benjamin Netanyahu-led Israeli government orchestrated the attacks on its citizens for political mileage. “Even a month ago, Netanyahu did not have this level of popular support…Should we leave this question out as to how Hamas intruded into the border of Israel? I am sure the answer to this question…” he cast aspersions on Israel instead of questioning Hamas terrorists.Ravish Kumar made the contentious remarks during his 39-minute-long rant on his YouTube channel on Monday (9th October).Similar claims were earlier peddled by ‘journalist’ turned politician Prashant Kanojia, who alleged, “Elections in Israel are going to take place soon. The current Israeli Prime Minister is also a coward like the Prime Minister of another nation. He also wants to attack his own citizens and win elections.”This is not the first time that Ravish Kumar has resorted to whitewashing extremists, responsible for widespread violence. In August 2020, he tried to absolve the radical Islamists of their complicity in the Bengaluru riots.In his usual sober voice, which helps propaganda sound seamlessly soothing, Ravish claimed on Friday, “Jo dangai hota hai vo dangai hota hai. Na toh unha Hindu mazhab see koi matlab hota hai na hi koi Muslim mazhab see koi matlab hota hai (A rioter is a rioter. He has nothing to due with Hindusim or Islam.)”Ravish further claimed, “Rioters look for a reason to be provoked. Those who know this game plan are well acquainted with the fact that a post can attract mobs who will unleash.” Through his claims, Ravish tried to deny the ‘communal angle’ in the Bengaluru carnage. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

First, this is NOT an etiquette of war in Islam to attack women, and hence this is condemnable.”The ex-scribe put out a token condemnation over the death of Louk only because ‘attacking women during war’ is supposedly against the tenets of Islam. Then, she proceeded to suggest that the victim was not stripped as she was not ‘fully naked.’One would have to suspend disbelief to believe what this woman is defending here. But, it is par for the course. Don’t underestimate the cruelty of the women of the barbaric cult. They are assigned various roles. One is the defence of a murder, the other is grooming in the… pic.twitter.com/ig50LljpwI“The woman is not fully naked, as parts of her upper & lower body are covered. If you check the Instagram account of Shani Louk (@shanukkk), you would see pictures she posted of herself wearing bikins or other skin-exposing outfits,” Irena Akbar brazened it out.She claimed that the victim could have been ‘partially naked’ at the time of her killing and not necessarily stripped by Hamas terrorists. “It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,” the former Indian Express ‘journalist’ said.“…I am being factual here, based on evidence from her own Instagram account where she would post pictures of herself in such clothes. So, it cannot be ruled out that Shani (with all due respect to her) was wearing a bikini or other similar garment when she was killed or captured,” she further alleged.Irena Akbar wrote, “And hence, it is possible that she was NOT stripped by the Hamas militants. However, as Islam prescribes modesty for women and men, and respect for the dead, the militants should have covered her body with a cloth or sheet, and treated it respectfully, or not attack her at all.”She then resorted to mental gymnastics and asked why people, who hail bikinis as a symbol of ‘freedom’, are raising concerns about seeing a woman’s uncovered body. The ex- Indian Express ‘journalist’ conveniently glossed over the fact that the victim was murdered, stripped and paraded by Hamas terrorists.“So, let’s be fair before jumping to outrage, or celebration. Also, I have a question for non- Muslims: You often share pictures of bikini- clad Iranian women on beaches before the Islamic Revolution of 1979. You lament that the women were “free and liberated” in Iran before Shariah law was adopted,” Akbar remarked.“You use the bikini as a symbol of freedom and liberation for Muslim women of Iran, and you contrast that with the hijab, a symbol of “oppression” under Iran’s mandatory hijab law. So, why do you have a problem when Shani Louk was possibly wearing a bikini (when she was sadly captured)?” she brazened out.“Why do you have a problem when her almost-naked body could be publicly seen? Are you again using a woman’s uncovered body to make a point against Palestinians, and Muslims?” the former ‘scribe’ concluded.In April 2021, Irena Akbar stirred the hornet’s nest by thanking Allah for the Coronavirus pandemic. She claimed “If it weren’t for Covid, Indian Muslims would’ve been in detention camps. I’m NOT being grateful for the virus which killed my aunt, sent my dad to the ICU & is causing tragedies across homes. I’m stressing the fact that while fascists were making their plans, God was making His.”“It’s between the devil & the deep blue sea for IMs. Either die/live in fear of Covid OR die/live in fear of anti-Muslim state violence. At least the former doesn’t specifically target us & the public will eventually question the state. But in latter, the public would rejoice it,” she added.In February 2020, she asserted that Dalits should never be trusted by the Muslim community. The Islamist claimed that the Dalits were the ‘foot soldiers’ when communal riots broke out in Gujarat in 2002 after a Muslim mob engineered the Godhra train carnage.“They did the dirty job of gang-raping and killing Muslims. I have never trusted them. They are ill-treated by their upper-caste Hindu brothers, not by Muslims. We owe them nothing,” she wrote. Irena Akbar also called for boycotts of business establishments run by Hindus. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

47,"4 October, 2023 ","Uttar Pradesh: Farmer reaches police station to file FIR against goats in Kanpur, accuses them of stealing flowers"," In a bizarre turn of events, a man in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur reached a police station to file complaint against goats for stealing his flowers. A bizarre case has come to light in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur where a person named Shailendra Nishad reached a police station with a complaint against goats for stealing flowers. According to him, some goats entered his field and started eating the marigold blooms. He was able to catch two of them from the spot which he then put in an auto and drove to the cops. This has created a peculiar situation for the authorities who are now in an odd predicament and unsure of what course of action to take.The strange incident which transpired in the Gauri Kakra village of the Bhitargaon block has turned into a topic of discussion in the neighbourhood. Flowers are cultivated around here and the complainant who is a farmer by profession is also into Floriculture. He had been worried for quite some time because someone would secretly pluck them in the evening. He asked the people of his hamlet regarding the same but could not find any information. On 2nd October, he decided against going to the city to sell the flowers and sat down with a stick to guard his fields. Meanwhile, in the evening he discovered that four to five goats had invaded his land from one side and devoured the flowers. He became outraged and tried to capture the four-legged thieves. However, he was able to nab only two of them after which he went straight to the road, loaded them into the vehicle and arrived at the police station. The policemen were astounded to witness the man with the goats and shocked to learn the reason behind his visit. When the cops inquired about the purpose of bringing the livestock there, he responded, “Sir, they quietly gorge on my flowers every day due to which I am suffering a lot of financial loss. However, the owner of the goats does not pay any attention to them. Therefore, I caught these goats which steal and eat my flowers and brought them here.”The cops were perplexed about what to do after hearing his story, however, they later found out who the animals belonged to. Police Inspector Pramod Kumar informed that they are of a girl in the village. Someone had loosed them and they went into the fields, but now instruction has been given to keep them tied. Authorities have also warned that the animals should not enter the victim’s fields again. The matter was resolved and he has forgiven the goat owner and no First Information Report was submitted either. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

48,"4 October, 2023 ",Anandotsav: How a new Bharatanatyam festival in Mumbai gave a sneak peek into the future of one of India’s ancient dance forms," To be able to resonate with the common man, even when they may or may not understand the intricacies of an ancient dance and art form like Bharatanatyam, is an achievement in itself. On a drizzly Saturday evening (30 September), when the maximum city generally turns into one big ball of blinding disco lights, the new seeds of Bharat’s ancient art and culture were sprouting in one of the suburbs of Mumbai. Chimes of ghungroos echoing with every taalam (rhythm) reverberated through the alleys of Vile Parle.“Aanandotsav”, the first annual Bharatanatyam festival organised by Kalaadnya Dance Academy in partnership with Nrityankur, marked the arrival of a new generation of Bharatanatyam performers. Both Kalaadnya and Nrityankur are affiliated with the Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya till Alankar Poorna (the final stage of Bharatanatyam training). Kalaadnya was founded in 2016 by Sayali Sutar, a Girnar Ratna awardee and Master in Bharatanatyam, who has performed across cities in and outside India. Sayali Sutar is a disciple of the great Vaibhav Arekar, founder of Sankhya Dance Company.The 163-seater auditorium of Sathye College was fully occupied by guests, friends and families of Devis, most of whom were delivering their debut performance. Gracing the occasion amongst the guests were Gautam Marathe, ace Bharatanatyam dancer and founder of Angika, and Pooja Pant, ace Kathak dancer and founder of Pooja Pant Dance Company.The show began with three young girls presenting their first piece called Todaimangalam, an invocation piece in praise of Shri Ganesha. The young performers were still just tracing their steps from the training but attempted to put their best foot forward aspiring to give a physical form to the Shlokas dedicated to Gajanana, Maa Saraswati, Mahalakshmi, and Bhagwan Shiva.The nervousness in the budding talent was evident even as their beautiful red costumes and vibrant shringar (make-up) enthralled the audience. This was the first time that many among the audience were witnessing their daughters perform Bharatanatyam, which many pursue as nothing more than an extra-curricular activity or a hobby but only a rare jewel makes it to the global stage.The show took the spectators through the journey of Bharatanatyam training. How yogic steps including sukshma vyayam (light exercises) are practised by Bharatanatyam dancers for muscle strengthening and toning to get the perfect posture were expressed with a tinge of humour in the performance called Natyobics.From hereon began the introduction to Bharatanatyam through Bharatanatyam. The youngest to the eldest dancers of Kalaadnya performed a piece called Adavumala, meaning a chain of basic movements of Bharatanatyam, choreographed by Sayali Sutar. The performance was followed by another piece called Alarippu, a flowering bud, which aptly describes the performers themselves.Vatsalya Padam, performed to the melodious bhajan ‘Krishna Ne Begane Baaro’ in Kannada language in Ragam Yamuna Kalyani and Talam Mishra Chapu, showed how Maa Yashoda is enchanted by the divinity of playing hide and seek with her son, Krishna, The Jagadguru. The blissful and wholesome choreography is credited to Vaibhav Arekar. It was performed by Kalaadnya student Mrunmayi Malpekar.The show then dives deeper into Bhakti, a state of divine trance if you will, with group performances to Achyutam Keshavam – a Hindi bhajan translated from the original Sanskrit rendition by Shri Adi Shankaracharya; Shri Ram Stuti, written by the supreme devotee of Bhagwan Ram, Goswami Tulsidas and choreographed by Sayali; and Kasturi Tilakam. Special mention goes to the sole boy dancer amongst a large group of girl dancers, like Krishna among Gopis.The Mallari performance was like a grand Ganesh Chaturthi celebration taking centre stage. It added a fun twist to this journey of performances dedicated to Devis and Devatas. The rendition conveyed India’s vibrant and magnificent religious processions when a temple deity is carried by an ocean of devotees out of His and Her humble abode on special occasions. Performed in Raga Nattai, Tala Aadi, this piece – performed by the terrific trio Srishti Ganesh, Pritha Bakshi, and Mrunmayi Malpekar – through Bharatanatyam, beautifully packaged the colours and excitement that Hindu religious processions bring to society.What came next was the show-stopper of the evening. From the music to the Bhakti in the performances listed above, there was a sense of familiarity. But the most intense aspect of Bharatanatyam revealed itself when Kalaadnya’s Srishti Ganesh performed Javali, a light classical love song with strokes of romantic gestures, something that the layman is used to witnessing only in movies most times. Such renditions are not easy to guage and understand unless the performer has used their expressions and mannerisms with precision. Srishti Ganesh achieved that beautifully. When she entered the stage, Srishti seemed to be on the backfoot owing to her light make-up, but from the very first to the last movement of her performance, Srishti had captured the attention of the spectators in its entirety. Her poetic mannerisms and the effortless ease with which she expressed a woman in love, being teased by and getting lost in the thoughts of her lover would make anyone want to fall in love.The order of the performances designed by the organisers deserves appreciation. The Jatiswaram performance, a purely Bharatanatyam recital sans abhinay, ensured that the flow of the show remained undisturbed as did the sentiments evoked by the previous performances.Instead of bringing the evening to a close, the festival concluded by welcoming Navratri and paying obeisance to Mahishasur Mardini and the ever-existing and all-knowing forms of Maha Shakti. The best part was the battle between Maa Durga and demon Mahishasur followed by the various forms of Devi Shakti.To be able to resonate with the common man, even when they may or may not understand the intricacies of an ancient dance and art form like Bharatanatyam, is an achievement in itself. That Kalaadnya’s Sayali and Nrityankur’s Arundhati through Anandotsav have taken it upon themselves to realise the aspirations of young and bright Bharatanatyam performers assures that the best of Indian culture is nowhere nearly lost and there’s surely more to come.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

49,"27 September, 2023 ",When a Hindu King did a ‘Sardar Patel’ 575 years ago: How Gajapati Kapilendra Deva from Odisha liberated Telangana from Islamic rule," Under the leadership of Kapilendra Deva of the Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty, a dynamic and forward-thinking ruler emerged. Unlike many of his contemporaries who adopted a defensive posture against Islamic kingdoms, Kapilendra Deva believed in taking the battle to enemy territories, and ultimately defeat the tyrant Sanjar Khan in modern-day Telangana region. A few days ago, we commemorated the Hyderabad Liberation Day, paying homage to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s strategic genius, which promptly put an end to the oppression of the Razakars under the Nizams, sparing the Hindu majority from further suffering. The well-coordinated and decisive action by the Indian Army dealt a crippling blow to the barbaric Razakars, who had subjected Hyderabad’s Hindus to unspeakable cruelty. This marked the realization of a long-cherished dream for the people of the region — freedom from the Nizam’s rule.Surprisingly, a strikingly similar historical parallel unfolded in the very same region nearly 575 years ago. During the reign of the formidable Bahmani Sultanate, ruled by Allaudin Ahmad Shah, almost the entire expanse of Telangana came under his dominion by 1448 CE. This conquest followed the expulsion of local Hindu chiefs who had held sway in the region for years.With most of Telangana under his control, Ahmad Shah appointed Sanjar Khan as the region’s governor. Khan proved to be a ruthless despot harbouring a profound hatred for the local Hindu population. He captured Hindus and forced them into servitude(Mukherjee Prabhat, The history of the Gajapati kings of Orissa, p.29), with women and children bearing the brunt of his brutality mostly. Throughout his rule, Hindus lived in perpetual fear of enslavement.Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Odisha, significant developments were underway. Under the leadership of Kapilendra Deva of the Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty, a dynamic and forward-thinking ruler emerged. Unlike many of his contemporaries who adopted a defensive posture against Islamic kingdoms, Kapilendra Deva believed in taking the battle to enemy territories. Starting with a relatively modest domain comprising 5-6 districts surrounding his capital, Cuttack, in Odisha, he expanded his realm all the way to the Krishna River in modern-day Andhra Pradesh by 1448 CE. Along the way, he decisively defeated the Sultanate of Bengal and Malwa, annexing their territories.With his dominion bordering that of Bahmanis he was not unaware of what was happening in Telengana. Therefore, the clash with the Bahmanis was just a matter of time. Sultan Ahmad Shah was well aware of the formidable Gajapati army’s military might, often reputed to include an astounding 2 lakh elephants (Mohapatra R P, Military history of Orissa, p. 122). While this might seem like an exaggeration, the Odia army indeed boasted a considerable number of elephants, which earned their kings the moniker “Gajapatis.” Nevertheless, the Sultan advised the stubborn Sanjar Khan to avoid tangling with the “possessors of elephants,”(Indian Antiquary Vol. XXVIII P. 237) recognizing that he was no match for them. This counsel fell on deaf ears, and haughty Sanjar Khan engaged the Gajapati army in battle. The Gajapati army was well prepared and had eagerly awaited this opportunity to strike at the Bahmanis. The stage for a fierce confrontation was set in modern-day Khammam, Telangana. Leading this pivotal battle was Hamvira Deva, Kapilendra’s son, and it ultimately led to the slaying of the tyrant Sanjar Khan (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.49). Finally, the Hindus of the region could breathe a sigh of relief.This marked the beginning of a series of invasions by Kapilendra into the Bahmani Sultanate’s territory. He not only liberated the entire Telangana region from the Bahmanis but also captured Mahur Fort, located in the modern-day Nanded district, Maharashtra from them. Other important forts like Racakonda, Devarkonda, Warangal (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.54) and many more fell into his hand. Ultimately, the Gajapati army laid siege to Bidar, the capital of the Bahmani kingdom in modern Karnataka. Sanjar Khan’s brutal reign was met with a resolute response from the Hindu conqueror Kapilendra Deva, culminating in the capture of the Bahmani capital (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.58). This historical episode bears an uncanny resemblance to the events in newly independent India. In the same region, the Razakars perpetrated heinous atrocities against the Hindu populace, and we witnessed how Sardar Patel’s brilliance ensured their demise.Such historical events underscore the importance of leaders with a profound understanding of prevailing geopolitical circumstances and an unwavering commitment to Hindu interests. However, it is essential to remember that such responses require meticulous long-term planning and years of preparation. Our history stands as a testament to our ability to execute such strategies successfully, both in the past and potentially in the future. Unfortunately, the significant achievements of this great king who at one point ruled along the east coast from the Hooghly River of West Bengal in the north to Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu in the south, have not been much explored by earlier scholars due to various reasons. This author has tried to put those in the form of a book titled “Gajapati Kapilendra Deva, The history of the greatest Hindu conqueror of 15th Century India”.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

50,"11 October, 2023 ","Maharashtra: Gaurakshaks in Pune save cows, Iqbal Alam and two other smugglers arrested; cow meat seized from a vehicle in Manchar"," During interrogation, Rahim Shaikh said that the cows were brought from Sanjay Pawar who lives in Pandit Jawahar Lal Colony at Canal Road behind Dasbhuja Ganapati Mandir on Karve Road in Pune. On Tuesday (10th October) Gorakshaks in Pune saved two cows from the clutches of cow smugglers who were taking the cows to a slaughterhouse in Pune. Iqbal Alam and other two smugglers were arrested in this case based on the complaint filed by Gorakshak Upendra Balkavde. In another incident in the Pune district, cow meat was seized from a car in Manchar on 9th October.Upendra Mahadev Balkawade, 32, works with the Hyundai Company in Pune. He has also been working as the Pune district president of the All India Krishi Go Seva Sangh for the last two years. Upendra Balkavde said in his complaint, “On 09/10/2023, around 09:30 pm, I received a call from my Gaurakshak colleague. He told me that two cows were being taken to Kondhwa Pune for slaughter in Motor Tempo Vehicle No. MH 12 QW 5747 from Rajaram Bridge Pune. Accordingly, my Gaurakshak colleagues Suraj Suresh Bandal, Ganesh Dattatray Sutar, Manish Mahadev Chavan and I sat in a motor car No. MH 12 OT 1400 at Dandekar Bridge and stopped on the road leading to Swargate.”He further stated, “On 09/10/2023 at around 11:45 pm, we saw the motor tempo heading towards Saaras Bagh and immediately we followed him in our car. We warned the tempo driver to stop. But the driver did not stop his vehicle and went ahead from Savarkar Chowk, Mitra Mandal Chowk. Laxmi Narayan Chowk, and Diasplot Chowk.”Upendra Balkavde added in his complaint, “Since the driver was not stopping his tempo, I stopped my car in front of his vehicle at Golden Bakery Diasplot Gultekdi Pune around 00:05 pm. We all got out of our car and inspected the tempo. The rear of the tempo was covered with green tarpaulin sheets. When the tarpaulin sheet was removed, we discovered two live cows, one white and one black-and-white. I called the police control room and called the police to the spot. When the police arrived, the police and I took the tempo and came to Swargate police station, Pune.”The three arrested accused are identified as Iqbal Alam (age 22, resident of Ghorpadi village in Pune), Rahim Ismail Shaikh (age 32), and Deepak Lallan Singh Thakur (age 30). During interrogation, Rahim Shaikh said that the cows were brought from Sanjay Pawar who lives in Pandit Jawahar Lal Colony at Canal Road behind Dasbhuja Ganapati Mandir on Karve Road in Pune. A case in this regard is registered in Swargate police station under sections 5 and 9(A) of the Maharashtra Animal Protection Act 1976, and sections 11(1)D, 11(1)E, and 11(1)I of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The Gaurakshaks and police took the cows to a local Jain Hindu Gaushala in Pune.A copy of this FIR is with OpIndia. OpIndia contacted Upendra Balkavde to learn more about the incident. He said, “We Gaurakshaks have an active network in and around Pune city. The accused in this case are arrested by police and will face legal consequences. We do our best using whatever capacities we have. The smugglers were taking the cows to Kondhwa. The Kondhwa area in Pune has become a hiding hub of Islamic terrorists. Recently, the NIA took action and nabbed a few such people who used to live there. Slaughterhouses are also in the same Kondhwa area.”Upendra Balkavde added, “Sanjay Pawar mentioned in this case supplies cows to these smugglers. We have caught him in two similar cases before this incident. He is a repeat offender. Most of the cow smugglers take cows to the Mumbai area. However, in and around Pune city, our group works hard to prevent cow slaughter and save Gaumata and Dharma.”Underlining the importance of coordinated efforts of all the Gaurakshaks, Upendra Balkavde said, “No mission is difficult when the community comes together to put a joint effort. Ours is not a very large group, but coordinated work gives effective output. In this operation, Sahil Pawar, Ganesh Sutar, Manish Chavan, Chetan Badole, Datta Pawar, Tanmay Babar, Sahil Kamble, Aniket Dalvi, Sachin Gaikwad, Suraj Bandal, Siddhesh Shigwan, and Shivam Sonawane played a crucial role. They were with me throughout the incident and took various responsibilities in this task to save the cows.”The incident came to light in the early hours of 9th October when beef weighing 405 kg was found in a four-wheeler that met with an accident on Pune Nashik Highway Road at Bhorwadi under Manchar police station limits. A case has been registered against the unidentified absconding driver and unidentified owner of the car. At approximately 3:50 am on 9th October, an unknown individual, driving a Ritz car with the registration MH06AZ7781, was travelling at a high speed on the Pune-Nashik Highway. This vehicle collided with the pickup truck, bearing the license plate MH14KQ7339, which was owned by Akshay Shankar Thorat, a resident of Manchar Pimpalgaon in the Ambegaon taluka, from behind.Partially cut organs and flesh of cattle weighing 405 kg worth Rs 81,000 were found in the car. The driver of the car escaped from the spot. A case has been registered against the driver and owner of the car under sections 279 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code, sections 184,134 (A)( B), and 177 of the Motor Vehicle Act, Sections 5, 5(c), and 9(a) of Maharashtra Animal Protection Amendment Act 1995, and section 11 of Indian Animal Protection Act.Police Sub-Inspector Shete is conducting a further investigation into this case under the supervision of Police Inspector Balwant Mandge. It is notable that Balwant Mandge is the same police officer who upheld the peace talks and restrained people from filing any case in a recent incident of a Hindu-Muslim scuffle during the Ganpati Visarjan procession in Manchar. A day after this incident, Islamists in Manchar attacked the house of a Bajrang Dal activist Suraj Chakradhar Dharam. When the members of Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad insisted that a case should be filed in this regard, the attackers apologised to Suraj Dharam and his family members with folded hands. A detailed report of this incident can be read here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

51,"9 October, 2023 ","Blood, Islam, and oil: The Saud family’s history of bloody battles with Ottomans, desert warlords, and partnership with the USA to become a global power"," After conquering Hejaz in 1925, Al Saud officially incorporated the title 'King of Najd and Hejaz'. In 1932, the two merged together to give birth to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - named after Abdulaziz’s family (Al Saud).On 9th September 2023, a groundbreaking agreement was unveiled during the G20 Summit in New Delhi with the announcement of a rail and shipping corridor from India to Europe via the Middle East. The project – ‘India-Middle East-Europe Shipping and Railway Connectivity Corridor’ (IMEE EC) is being hailed as the new spice route in the new world order. As part of the IMEE EC project, ‘moderate’ Saudi Arabia and ‘Jewish-majority’ Israel have come closer than ever to normalise their diplomatic ties. Reportedly, Saudi Arabia is engaged in negotiations with the United States to sign a defense pact in exchange for establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, a nation that was considered a pariah in the Islamic world. However, reports suggest that Saudi Arabia will not obstruct a deal even if Israel does not grant significant concessions to the Palestinians in their quest for statehood. Apparently, these changing geopolitical happenings are being attributed as one of the motives behind the recent terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel. Although the Hamas-initiated attacks could derail or delay the deal, back-channel diplomacy continues to bridge gaps and bring the Saudi-US deal closer to finalisation. Against this backdrop, the Middle Eastern region is potentially at the cusp of marking an end to the dominance of Wahhabi ideology which was deeply rooted in a puritanical interpretation of Islam, in the Middle East and its spheres of influence.  Remarkably, the Wahhabi ideology has exerted its dominance and molded the course of events across the Middle East for the better part of three centuries. It also played a pivotal role in the formation of the modern Middle East, notably Saudi Arabia as it stands today, and the consolidation of power by the Al Saud, the ruling monarchy of Saudi Arabia. The power dynamics in the region are an outcome of alliances both matrimonial (blood pact), religious pacts, and regional partnerships that were born out of inter-imperial battles between the Ottoman and British Empires.    In the 18th century, Muhammad ibn Saud from the Al Saud (Al being referred to as family) was a Chieftan of a small oasis town of Diriyah on the outskirts of modern-day Riyadh. During his reign, an Islamic fundamentalist theologian, Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab sought refuge in Diriyah as he was thrown out of Hejaz, the region that housed both the holy sites of Islam – Mecca and Medina. Wahhab’s extremist interpretation of Islam had irked the Hashmites who had been Sharifs of these holy sites for several centuries. These Sharifs who hailed from the Hashmites tribe of Hejaz owed allegiance to the Ottoman Empire. The Islamic Empire had limited or nominal direct interest in the affairs of the Middle Eastern region primarily because of the lack of resources in the Middle East in general, the Najd region in particular, and its unfavorable desert climate. However, it maintained a significant interest in the religious pilgrimage routes and at the holy sites of Islam.Meanwhile, Chieftan Mohd ibn Saud not only gave refuge to Wahhab but also signed a pact with him in 1744 marking the beginning of the First Saudi state. Under the pact which is often dubbed as “Wahhabi-Saudi Pact”, Mohd ibn Saud remained as the Emir while Wahhab assumed the title of ‘Imam’. To strengthen the pact, Ibn Saud’s eldest son married al-Wahhab’s daughter. Al Saud publicly embraced Wahhabism. As a theologian, Wahhab also went on to lay the foundation of “Wahhabism” in the region. The aim of this pact was to bring purity to the faith and establish a puritanical form of Islam. Soon, Wahhabism became the official Saudi religious doctrine. Under this extreme form, religious innovation (bidaa) was vehemently rejected and it advocated for eliminating practices such as Sufi rites and veneration of saints. During their conquest outside Najd, they destroyed shrines of the Shia minority. The Wahabis used the slur ‘Rafida’ (rejecters) to refer to Shia, which still continues in the 21st century. On the other hand, the Emir of Diryiah Mohd ibn Saud started expanding control over various tribal regions in Najd (the central part of current-day Saudi Arabia) and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. He had gained religious certification from Imam Abdul Wahhab. Subsequently, brainwashed ‘Wahhabist’ tribes like Ikhwan joined his religious conquest of the Arabian Peninsula, under the Al Saud banner.The Emir also formed alliances with tribal leaders and groups in Najd, including the Ajman and Otaiba tribes. These alliances were mostly based on a mix of military cooperation and shared religious ideals, particularly Wahhabi Islam.However, the battle of consolidation included fierce battles against the rival Al Rashid (Rashidi family) and the Hashemite Sharif of Mecca, who had support from Egypt, the vassalage of the Ottoman Empire. In 1765, the Emir of Diriyah, Muhammad bin Saud passed away but by then the Wahhabis had controlled Najd and expanded in all directions, including Mecca and Medina. He was succeeded by his son Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud Al Saud as the new Emir of Diriyah.The period between 1811-1818 saw battles which are also known as the Egyptian-Wahhabi War as it was fought by the Egyptian representative of Ottoman and Wahhabists from Diriyah under the Al Saud banner. During the religiously zealous conquest, when the Egyptian subjects of Ottomans attempted to invade al-Hasa’ which lies in eastern Arabia, the Wahhabis seized the holy city of Karbala’ in Turkish Iraq (1801). It was followed by capturing Mecca itself in 1802. By the year 1805, the Wahhabis controlled Mecca and Medina. They had also attacked Karbala and the Imam Husayn Shrine which directly challenged the Ottoman Empire and their vassalage, Egyptians and Hashmite Sharifs of Mecca. Furthermore, under the leadership of Emir Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud, the Wahhabis targeted Ottoman trade routes, badly impacting the finances of the Ottoman Empire. The Emir of Diryiah also openly denounced and questioned the Ottoman Sultan Mustafa IV, challenging his legitimacy as the Caliph and protectorate of the faithful and holy sites in Hejaz.Following that, in 1811, the Ottoman Sultan Mahmoud II ordered Muhammad Ali Pasha, who was considered the Wāli in Egypt, to check the expansionist spree of the Emir of Diryiah. Ali then assigned his son, Tusun Pasha, to lead a force of 10,000 soldiers. However, in 1812, the Emir of Diriyah, Abdullah defeated Tusun Pasha at Al-Safra. But with a reinforcement of 10,000 men, Pasha recaptured Mecca and Medina. On account of poor health, Tusun tried to forge a treaty with the Emir in which Hejaz was to be surrendered & vassalage offered. However, neither Ali nor the Sultan ratified the treaty with the House of Saud. In 1816 Tusun Pasha died and with mutual distrust abound, the war resumed with Ali’s other son, Ibrahim Pasha assumed leadership and led an expedition, driving the Saudi Emir and his “Wahhabis” (more properly Salafis) into the desert of Najd.Subsequently, in 1818 Ibrahim marched across the desert and brought his forces to the gates of Diriyah. They ruthlessly massacred the male population of the rebel force. Diriyah was razed to the ground and all Wahhabi theologians found were executed. The captured Emir of Diriyah Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud was brought to Istanbul where he was publicly beheaded and his head was thrown into the Bosphorus. Additionally, the Wahhabis were compelled to listen to music, an act strictly prohibited in Wahhabism.This marked the ending of the first Saudi state (1744-1818) which had begun with the Saudi-Wahhabi pact. Two years after causing disruption in Najd, Ottoman forces withdrew from the region. Over the ensuing eighty years, the Al Saud made several attempts to regain control of the Arabian Peninsula, but their efforts failed courtesy of the Ottoman-Al Rashidi alliance. Son of Former Emir of Diriyah, Turki bin Abdullah bin Muhammad Al Saud and a few others had managed to escape the Ottoman carnage and soon after the Ottoman’s withdrawal, they started to regain their lost territories.  By 1824, the Al-Saud family had regained political control of central Arabia. With Diryiah in ruins, the Saudi ruler Turki bin Abdullah Al-Saud transferred his capital to Riyadh which was some 20 miles south of Diriyah. With this, he established the Second Saudi State. In his 11 years of reign, Turki recaptured most of the lands lost to the Ottoman Empire. The Second Saudi State, under the leadership of Turki and his son Faisal, came to an end when the Al-Rashid family of Hail, with the backing of the Ottomans, successfully overthrew the Saudi State. This occurred during the Ottoman Empire’s renewed campaign in 1865 to expand its influence in the Middle East. Ottoman armies had captured parts of the Saudi State, which was ruled at the time by Faisal’s son, Abdulrahman. After repeated defeats by a much larger and better-equipped army, Abdulrahman bin Faisal Al-Saud abandoned the struggle in 1891 marking the end of the Second Saudi state. During the exile, he sought refuge with the Bedouin tribes in the vast sand desert of eastern Arabia known as the Rub’ Al-Khali, or ‘Empty Quarter.’ From there, Abdulrahman and his family traveled to Kuwait, where they stayed until 1902. His young son Abdulaziz became the head of secular and military matters while he was in exile. Over the course of time, he launched raids and terrorised the tribes loyal to the Al Rashidis with an aim to regain Al Saud territories from Rashidis, the vassalage of Ottomans. On 15th January 1902, Abdulaziz, a direct descendent of Muhammad ibn Saud, accompanied by only 40 followers – mostly his blood relatives, half-brothers, cousins, and Kingsmen launched a daring night mission. They scaled the walls of Riyadh’s citadel to capture the city garrison, known as the Masmak Fortress. The Rashidi governor and his loyal man were slaughtered in cold blood. Reviving the emirate of Najd, with Abdulaziz as Emir and Abdul Rahman as Imam, this raid marked the beginning of the establishment of the third Saudi estate which continues to this present day and is known as the modern Saudi state.Meanwhile, during World War 1 (1914-1919), the Al Saud aligned with the British Empire against their common foe, the Ottoman Turks, and their Arabian allies. He signed the Treaty of Darin with the British in 1915 which recognised his authority over much of Najd and established a formal alliance.Around the same time, Britishers lured Hejaz into its own orbit and pulled it away from the Ottomans which later proved to be a great betrayal for the Hashimites. Evidently, during the ‘Arab Revolt’ (1916-1918), the Hejaz area (Mecca and Medina) broke free from the Ottomans. This was led by Shareef Hussein, the founder of the Hashemite dynasty and he declared himself king of the Arab countries as well as later, the new Caliph. However, in reality, he was only the king of Hejaz. Hussein was originally the Sharif of Mecca. In the present-day context, the descendants of Hashemite dynasties are now the monarchs of Jordan. Notably, the British and French had an agreement called the Sykes-Picot Agreement to divide some territories of the Middle East. Palestine, Jordan, and Iraq were actually controlled by the British. At the same time, Syria was controlled by the French. After capturing Riyadh, Al Saud wanted to expand further and consolidate the tribal areas once and for all. Apart from allying with Britishers, Abdulaziz also allied with the fierce nomadic warrior tribe of Bedouins, Ikhwan, or Muslim brothers. The Ikhwan had been brainwashed in Wahhabi ideology during the reign of Abdulaziz’s forefathers. Together they crushed all rebels including Ottoman’s effort to intervene. They captured Mecca in 1924 and Medina in 1925 which were ruled by Hashimites who had been pulled away from Ottomans by the British, yet British ally Al Saud ended 700 years of rule of Hashmities as Sharif of the Holy cities of Islam (barring a few years in between).   Consequently, Abdulaziz became the ruler of the Two Holy Cities of Islam. However, afterward, Al Saud crushed Ikhwan in 1929, their Muslim warriors as they had an uncontrollable urge to spread Wahhabism beyond Arabia despite Abd al-Aziz imposing restrictions on them. The Ikhwan had started considering them corrupt due to their enormous wealth and Western allies. After conquering Hejaz in 1925, Al Saud officially incorporated the title ‘King of Najd and Hejaz’. In 1932, the two merged together to give birth to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – named after Abdulaziz’s family (Al Saud).In order to forge unity in his newly established kingdom, Abd al-Aziz entered into marital alliances by marrying daughters from every powerful tribe in the region and influential clerical families, he had around twenty wives, however, not more than four wives at a time, in accordance with Quranic principles. With these unions, he had 45 legitimate sons and an undisclosed number of daughters (with daughters typically not being counted). His half-brothers and cousins assisted him in conquering the peninsula. However, he started consolidating power in favor of his own sons. Since then, every Saudi king has been a son of Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman aka MBS is his only grandson who has risen to power. Despite having an alliance with the British, Saudi Arabia was wary of its imperial ambitions, and moving forward it found an ally in the United States. Consequently, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. established diplomatic relations. Subsequently, in 1933, the initial foreign oil explorers made their way to the kingdom. The Americans, in a significant transaction, paid $170,000 in gold for land concessions that, as it turned out, held the world’s largest oil reserves. Despite facing criticism that the invitation of foreigners into the kingdom contradicted Islamic principles and citing precedent from the Quran, King Abd al-Aziz extended an invitation to U.S. oil companies to help develop Saudi Arabia’s oil resources. Collaboratively, the oil companies and the Saudi government established a joint venture, which later evolved into the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), with shareholders that included America’s four largest oil corporations.While the kingdom maintained a stance of neutrality during World War II, it leaned towards the Allies. Towards the war’s conclusion, King Abd al-Aziz held meetings with both UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). In 1945, despite health concerns for both leaders, King Abd al-Aziz and FDR met for three days aboard the U.S.S. Quincy, which was docked in the Suez Canal. The Quincy Agreement laid the groundwork for Saudi-American cooperation in matters related to oil and defense. Additionally, the two leaders solidified a confidential pact: King Abd al-Aziz pledged to grant the US secure access to Saudi oil, while in return, the US committed to providing military assistance, training, and the construction of the Dhahran military base in Saudi Arabia.Since then, barring a few instances of power struggles within the Royal family, the House of Saud has been a stable power in the Middle East and the country leading the oil powers in the region. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

52,"9 October, 2023 ","As Hamas attack on Israel triggers a war in Middle East, here is all you need to know about Hamas and the Gaza Strip"," Hamas is a designated terrorist entity and for this reason, it is barred from getting
official assistance that the United States and European Union (EU) provide to the PLO in the West Bank.On 7th October (Saturday), Israel came under one of the worst attacks in recent history after dozens of Hamas terrorists infiltrated the Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip. Additionally, Palestinian terrorists also launched massive rocket barrages at southern and central Israel from the Gaza Strip prompting it to declare a ‘state of war’. The terrorists also held several Israelis hostage including women, children, and the elderly. They have killed several civilians in indiscriminate firing and videos of the incident doing rounds on the internet reveal that they had also paraded women bared and bruised on the streets of Israeli towns.Following the terrorist attack on Israel, Palestinian Islamic Movement, Hamas claimed responsibility for these attacks. In a rare public statement, the leader of the military wing of Hamas, Mohammed Deif announced that it has launched a new military operation against Israel. Mohammed Deif added that 5,000 rockets had been fired into Israel early Saturday to begin “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm” and provoked all Palestinians to fight. It is important to note that Deif’s provocation was delivered in a recording as he has been in hiding after surviving multiple assassination attempts.On its part, Israeli forces have started retaliation and are fighting to regain control of areas captured by the Hamas terrorists. Amidst this, here is a brief overview of everything about this outfit1 Hamas, including its genesis, its supporters, and how it draws funds to attack Israel. Hamas is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, which means “Islamic Resistance Movement” in English. It was founded by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin who was a Palestinian cleric. After doing Islamic scholarship in Cairo, he was associated with the local branches of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the 1960s, Yassin preached religious sermons in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Subsequently, in December 1987, Yassin established Hamas as the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza. This came in the backdrop of the first intifada – Palestinian attacks against Israel for alleged atrocities in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. Initially, Hamas believed that Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was a threat to the Muslim Brotherhood so it did everything to ‘counter’ it. In 1988, Hamas published its charter which called for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic society in historic Palestine. Since April 1993, Hamas has been carrying out suicide bombings. The first reported bombing was done five months before PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the Oslo Accords. The historic accord led to the establishment of limited self-government for parts of the West Bank and Gaza. A new entity called the Palestinian Authority (PA) was created for this purpose. However, Hamas condemned and tried to derail these developments towards peace. It also condemned the PLO’s and Israel’s recognition of each other.Later, in 1997, the United States designated Hamas a foreign terrorist organisation as it went on to spearhead violent resistance during the second intifada, in the early 2000s. Hamas’s founder, Yassin was killed by Israeli forces in 2004.Apart from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), Hamas is the other major outfit in Palestinian territories. Since 2006, the Islamist outfit Hamas has controlled the Gaza Strip. Back then, it defeated its rival political party, Fatah, in elections but after that, there hasn’t been any election in the Palestinian enclave.It is notable that the Palestine state is divided into two territories, the Werst Bank on the east of Israel, and the Gaza Strip on the west. While Hamas governs Gaza, the governance of the West Bank, the much larger territory bordering Jordan and the Dead Sea apart from Israel, is complicated. While the West Bank is generally under the occupation is Israel, there are a large number of Palestinian enclaves that are under total or partial control of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).While anti-Israel sentiments prevail in the entire Palestinian state, this sentiment is strongest in the Gaza Strip, which is under Hamas rule.Gaza Strip is a 41km-long and 6-12 km-wide territory between Israel, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea. It has one of the highest population densities in the world with a population of about 2.3 million people. Israel exercises control over the airspace above Gaza and its coastline, regulating the entry and exit of people and goods through its border crossings. Likewise, Egypt governs the passage of individuals into and out of Gaza through its border. According to the UN, almost 80% of the Gazans depend on international aid, and about one million people rely on daily food aid. However, it is often reported that millions of foreign aid and funds from like-minded countries were funneled to anti-Israel activities including terror attacks. In fact, Hamas which is ‘governing’ the Gaza Strip is notorious for launching attacks, and suicide bombings on Israel. Notably, dozens of nations, including Israel, the United States, and the European Union as a bloc, have classified Hamas as a terrorist organisation, particularly its military wing, due to its involvement in suicide bombings and acts of terror directed against Israel.Hamas has several bodies that perform various political, military, and social functions. There is an overarching consultative body referred to as the politburo. It operates in exile and sees the ‘General policy’ of the outfit. The grassroots issues in Gaza and the West Bank are seen by the local committees of Hamas. Since June 2021, Gaza’s de facto prime minister is Issam al-Da’alis.Whereas, Ismail Haniyeh is the political head after he replaced longtime leader Khaled Meshaal in 2017. Since 2020, he along with other Hamas leadership has been operating from Doha in Qatar because Egypt limited his movement into and out of Gaza. Previously, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. Meanwhile, some of the Hamas leadership has an office in Turkey and they reportedly operate from there.Meanwhile, Yahya Sinwar who served twenty-two years in an Israeli prison for masterminding the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers sees ‘day-to-day’ affairs in Gaza. He was released from prison along with more than one thousand Palestinian prisoners in 2011 in exchange for an Israeli soldier held by Hamas terrorists.Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, is commanded by Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif. It is important to note that the responsibility for recent terrorist attacks on Israel was taken by Deif stating that Hamas has carried out ‘Operation Al-aqsa storm’.   The founder of Hamas military wing, Salah Shehadeh was assassinated by the Israeli forces in a 2002 air strike. Hamas operates from Lebanon which is reportedly headed by Saleh al-Arouri. He also took over Hamas’ West Bank leadership after internal elections in 2021. Hamas maintains close ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon.Hamas is a designated terrorist entity and for this reason, it is barred from getting official assistance that the United States and European Union (EU) provide to the PLO in the West Bank. Apart from funding from Palestinian expatriates, private donors in the Persian Gulf, and Islamic charities in the West, Hamas reportedly gets financial and other support from Iran, Turkey, and Qatar among other Islamic nations.   Iran is one of the biggest benefactors of Hamas as it contributes funds, weapons, and training to fight a proxy war against Israel. Iran pumps funds to the tune of $100 million annually to Hamas, PIJ, and other Palestinian outfits designated as terrorist organisations by the United States.However, during the Syrian civil war, Iran and Hamas had a brief fallout with each other.Qatar also provides hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to Gaza through Hamas. However, foreign aid generally reaches Gaza via the PA and UN agencies. Earlier, Hamas amassed funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood. Afterwards, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Additionally, Turkey is another backer of the Hamas particularly after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rose to power in 2002. Though it claims that it backs Hamas only politically, Ankara has been accused of funding Hamas’s terrorism, including through aid diverted from the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency.Hamas has been in control of Gaza since Israel’s withdrawal from the territory in 2005. In the subsequent year, Hamas got a majority of seats in the PA’s legislative body and established a government. It is claimed that Palestinians believed that Fatah’s leadership had become corrupt during its tenure within the PLO and had achieved limited progress in Palestinian-Israeli negotiations which resulted in Hamas getting the majority, after which it has never conducted an election. Since 2006, Palestinians have not voted for a legislature, nor for a president since 2008.However, Fatah rejected the outcome of the elections and the party ousted Hamas from power in the West Bank. While in Gaza, Hamas hunted down Fatah’s militias to extend its authoritative control.  In theory, Hamas follows the Sharia-based Palestinian Basic Law, as does the PA. However, Hamas is notorious for implementing an extreme version of Sharia, including controlling how women dress and enforcing gender segregation in public during the early years of its rule. It has repressed media, civilian activism on social media, the political opposition, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Gaza who argue that more focus should be diverted towards the welfare of Gazans than launching terror attacks on Israel.Hamas has been firing a spree of rockets and mortars into Israel after it took over Gaza. Iranian security officials admitted that Tehran provided some of these weapons. However, after getting training from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and proxies, Hamas has been building its own missiles as well. Additionally, Hamas has been dropping hundreds of balloons laden with inflammatory substances and explosives, along with rockets on Israeli territories causing indiscriminate death and destruction to civilians. Israel has responded fiercely and unsparingly against the continued provocation, with persistent airstrikes and tank fires on locations described by it as Gaza’s military infrastructure installations.Hamas has also launched incursions into Israeli territory, and it is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks including the recent one which is still ongoing. One of the most infamous incidents occurred in 2006 when they kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. In exchange for Shalit’s release, Israel released more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners, including Sinwar. Additionally, in 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of abducting and killing three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

53,"8 October, 2023 ","‘My son is not a criminal’, says the mother of Nilesh Parmar who was arrested after Vadodara incident where Islamists pelted stones on Ganesh Visarjan Yatra"," Earlier, OpIndia had also spoken to the local Savli police station about the incident. The local police confirmed the arrest of Nilesh Parmar.During the Ganpati Visarjan procession at Manjusar in Vadodara, a Muslim mob pelted stones at Hindu procession. Many people were injured in the attack and the idol of Lord Ganesha was also damaged. Both parties lodged complaints with the police after the stone pelting. During their operation, the police detained a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker from Savli, Nilesh Parmar, and later sent him to Ahmedabad Central Jail under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA). Hindu organisations and locals opposed the action, calling it unfair. In the meantime, OpIndia contacted Nilesh Parmar’s family and tried to know their side.Nilesh Parmar, an RSS volunteer, hails from the village of Gothada in Savli taluka. This village predominantly consists of Muslim residents, with the village sarpanch also being of the Muslim faith. We spoke to his mother, Madhuben Thakorbhai Parmar. Throughout our discussion, Madhuben’s voice exhibited a sense of distress, clearly affected by the recent turn of events involving her son. Throughout our interaction, Madhuben consistently asserted that Nilesh was entirely innocent. She claimed that Nilesh was present at a different location on the day of the incident in question. She said that Nilesh had actually gone out to attend a social gathering.When OpIndia spoke to Nilesh’s mother Madhuben, she said at the very beginning of the conversation that her 26-year-old son was not guilty in any way. He is an RSS volunteer and always raises his voice for the country, religion and society leading from the front. Madhuben said, “Our village is Muslim majority and the sarpanch is also a Muslim. There are frequent clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the village and taluka. In such a situation, Nilesh has become a known face among Hindus due to his service work at a young age. Seeing this, the local political leaders started feeling jealous. That’s why he is often being targeted in this way.”Nilesh’s mother further said, “This is not the first time that my son’s name has been linked to a crime without any reason. Even before this, Nilesh’s name has been wrongly linked in various complaints many times. His name is not mentioned in the primary complaint, then later his name is added to the statements of the accused due to political pressure.”When we talked about the incident in Manjusar, she said, “Sangeetaben Sanjaybhai Parmar of our family died on the same day and at the same time as the incident in Manjusar. So our entire family, including Nilesh, was engaged in a post-death ritual here. Nilesh was not present at the spot where the commotion took place. His name has been wrongly added to the statement by the police under political pressure.”While talking further, Madhuben became emotional remembering her son. She told OpIndia that her son was falsely implicated. She demanded justice for her son. We asked her about her son’s affiliation with RSS. She said, “My son was involved with RSS since childhood, is now in RSS and will continue to be so. While working in the RSS, he has been doing many service works for the local people which he is proud of.”OpIndia also spoke to Nilesh’s cousin Kewal Parmar. He also said that his brother had been falsely implicated. Kewal said, “Earlier in 2021, Nilesh had organised a street march of RSS in Gothada village. Even then, it was opposed by the local Muslims and the Muslim sarpanch who said that the RSS yatra should not be taken out in our village. At that time too, Nilesh was harassed a lot.”Kewal further said, “Nilesh was gradually becoming popular among the local Hindu community and Hindu youths for his service work. In a Muslim-dominated area like Savli, he expanded the scope of the RSS work. Due to this, there were many attempts to implicate him in a false case repeatedly.”Finally, he said that no matter what happens, he will not give up and will continue to fight on every judicial path to get justice for his brother Nilesh Parmar.Earlier, OpIndia had also spoken to the local Savli police station about the incident. The local police confirmed the arrest of Nilesh Parmar.

54,"14 October, 2023 ","“Today I realise how lucky we are as Indians”, Shehla Rashid credits PM Modi for peace and safety in Kashmir after prosecution sanction granted against her"," Though Shehla Rashid has turned off replies to these tweets, many people have lauded her for speaking the truth about the changed reality of Kashmir particularly after the abrogation of Article 370. On 14th October (Saturday), JNU alumna and Kashmir-based ‘activist’ Shehla Rashid took to X to heap praise on PM Modi, the administration in Jammu and Kashmir along with the Indian Army in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. Reacting to the fast-paced developments in the Middle East, she asserted that these developments have made her realise how lucky we are as Indians.  In her post, she wrote, “Looking at the events in the Middle East, today I realise how lucky we are as Indians. The Indian Army and security forces have sacrificed their everything for our safety. Credit where it’s due.”Looking at the events in the Middle East, today I realise how lucky we are as Indians. The Indian Army and security forces have sacrificed their everything for our safety.Credit where it's due @pmoindia @HMOIndia @manojsinha_ @adgpi @ChinarcorpsIA for bringing peace to Kashmir https://t.co/qeUCkJq9g3She also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Manoj Sinha, the Indian Army, and the Chinar Corps of the Indian Army for bringing peace to Jammu and Kashmir.Former JNU alumna Shehla Rashid also noted that peace can’t be ensured without security and the ongoing crisis in the Middle East stamps it further. She added that the Chinar Corps of the Indian Army, along with the brave soldiers of the CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir Police, have made tremendous sacrifices to ensure long-term peace and security in Kashmir.Peace is impossible without security, as the Middle East crisis has shown. The Indian Army @ChinarcorpsIA along with @crpfindia and brave personnel of Jammu Kashmir Police @JmuKmrPolice have made tremendous sacrifices to ensure long-term peace and security in Kashmir 🙏Though Shehla Rashid has turned off replies to these tweets, many people have lauded her for speaking the truth about the changed reality of Kashmir particularly after the abrogation of Article 370. However, in the past, she had an illustrious career in peddling fake news and spreading anti-India rhetoric in Kashmir. Notably, she has previously served as the former vice-president of the JNU student union and did politics on behalf of AISA, the student organisation of left parties. Back then, she made regular statements against BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even resorted to fake news peddling on many instances to show a false narrative of Muslims being victimised in Jammu and Kashmir by the ‘oppressive’ Indian Armed forces.   In one instance, she even went to peddle fake news to implicate the Indian army in a bad light and toed the line of Pakistani propaganda against the security forces which was exposed by the Indian Army. In a series of tweets, Rashid alleged that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is grim and that the armed forces are using excessive force on the Kashmiris. It is notable that Shehla Rashid’s change of heart in the matter comes just days after the Delhi LG granted sanction for a case against her over her comments spreading fake news. Supreme Court lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava had filed a criminal complaint against Shehla Rashid for her comments, seeking her arrest for allegedly spreading fake news against the Indian Army and the government. The complaint stated that she had prima facie committed an offence of sedition under Section 124-A of IPC. It added that Rashid has further committed offences of ‘promoting enmity between the classes’ under Sections 153, 153-A, 504, and 505 of IPC.In connection to her baseless tweets against the Indian army, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, VK Saxena on 10th January, this year granted prosecution sanction against Shehla Rashid. It allowed the prosecution to charge her under section 196 of CrPC, 1973, for her tweets against the Indian Army. For the last few days, the Former JNUSU Vice President Shehla Rashid has spent time in Kashmir, and post the prosecution sanction against her in connection to the fake news against the Indian Army, she has been retracting some of her earlier stances. For example, she had once approached the Supreme Court against the decision to abrogate Article 370. However, she recently withdrew her petition over this issue. Similarly, earlier this year, on the occasion of Independence Day, she responded positively to the news of Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist Javed’s brother Raees Mattoo hoisting the Indian national flag. Reflecting on that, she had also asserted that the situation has improved in the state followed by recent tweets where she has underscored the changed reality of Kashmir and praised PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for peace and safety in Kashmir.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Muhammad Rizwan, who managed to score a century in the match against Sri Lanka, dedicated his country’s win to “brothers and sisters in Gaza.” He also thanked the Indian audience and added, “Extremely grateful to the people of Hyderabad for the amazing hospitality and support throughout.”However, the cricketer received a lot of flak for interjecting politics into the game. A raft of social media users took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to flay the Pakistani cricketer for using the platform of the World Cup to promote his political and religious ideology. Notably, Muhammad Rizwan is infamous for fusing politics, religion and sports much like several of his countrymen. He recently caught the attention of many when he started offering Namaz on the cricket field during the second half of the match against the Netherlands while his teammates awaited drinks during the break. He received condemnation for doing the same just in front of Indians.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

60,"14 October, 2023 ",India extends its unbeaten streak in the World Cups to 8-0 as Rohit Sharma and company steamrolls Pakistan in Ahmedabad," India registered an emphatic victory over arch-rival Pakistan in the crucial World Cup match played at Ahmedabad, extending their unbeaten streak to 8-0. Before Rohit Sharma's magnificent blitzkrieg lit up the Narendra Modi stadium, it was the clinical bowling by India that cleaned up Pakistan for 191. In a one-sided affair, India once again proved to be a better side pulling a convincing victory against a formidable but unpredictable Pakistani side. With this 7-wicket victory, India has improved its net run rate and thrown open the doors of qualification which now seems to be an inevitable outcome. Dubbed as the greatest cricketing rivalry, the Pakistani openers after having been asked to bat first made a tentative but solid start. After seeing off the first over by Jasprit Bumrah and getting one boundary, both the Pakistani openers, Abdullah Shafique and Imam-ul-Haq didn’t let Mohd Siraj settle down and thrashed the balls on either side of the pitch. Without taking any risk or letting the pressure of the big game dawn on them, they scored at a consistent rate of 5 runs per over. However, on the last ball of the eight over, World number 2, Siraj drew the first blood when he caught aggressive Shafique right in front of the wickets and compensated his bleeding economy with the wicket. Soon after, India’s first bowling change, Hardik Pandya also chipped and ended a brewing partnership before it could start troubling India. Both the senior campaigners, Babar Azam and Muhammad Rizwan consolidated the innings and made the black soil top appear as a batting-friendly pitch with Pakistan eyeing a high 300 target for India to chase in the mega encounter. But despite hitting the bad and some good balls to gaps and getting boundaries on regular intervals, the Pakistani side never got going and hardly scored above the run-a-ball rate, that is, they hardly breached 6 CRR (current run rate), let alone press foot on the accelerator. Even when, both the senior batters were on the pitch and before Babar perished in a cheeky attempt to guide the ball for a single to the third man, the run rate was slightly above 5 as they were around the 150 mark by the start of the 30th over. Afterwards, the Pakistani batting line-up collapsed like a house of cards, an uncanny feature, unpredictability, for which Pakistan is famous. From 155/2 they were bundled out for 191/10 as all Indian bowlers registered two wickets a piece to their name. While it is said that sweep and reverse sweep are effective tools to neutralise spin and disarray the spinner, Pakistani batters deployed it in desperation ending up getting knotted in the spin web and throwing away their wickets. Iftikar couldn’t read Kuldeep from his hand and dragged the ball to his wicket, Saud Shakeel got trapped in front of the wicket. Other than that, Hasan Ali’s few boundaries after the dismissal of Babar, Pakistani batting looked like a nine-pin ball and no batter breached the double-figure mark. Meanwhile, Rizwan also could not provide stability and himself got dismissed before he could complete his fifty. However, once the Indian side saw an opportunity, it relentlessly went after wickets and didn’t let the pressure ease a bit. This included inspired bowling changes by the skipper Rohit Sharma, ring fielders going aggressive to keep the batsmen on strike, and facing more balls.  Remarkably, low-scoring games have been dicey in the past as they had sent teams either in complacency or in shell, with batters blocking even juicy half-volleys, however, it doesn’t seem to be the case with the Indian innings.With a clear target in sight, Indian openers started with a positive intent keeping in mind the longer format of this tournament and the importance of net run rate at later stages of the tournament. The positive intent was on display from the very first ball as skipper Rohit Sharma smashed Shaheen Afridi for a boundary picking his red-hot form from where he left it last time. As a batter, the World Cup stage has been a happy hunting ground for Rohit Sharma with 7 centuries in the mega tournaments already before his name. Shubman Gill, who returned after being down with dengue made his World Cup debut and looked exuberant matching his skipper. While he was looking in dangerous form, he departed early after scoring a quickfire 16 off 11 balls and lofting the ball in the air for an easy catch for Shadab Khan to pouch.With India being the hosting nation, the entire Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad rallied along and lifted the spirit with soul-foul chantings.  Highlight of #INDvsPAK🇮🇳❤️pic.twitter.com/7pfqVasxxJThe stage was set for Virat Kohli, arguably the best exponent of flawless batting in contemporary times, to chase down the score set by the Pakistani side. The master of the run chase, Kohli first fended off the first ball of Shaheen Afridi to avoid a re-run of Champions trophy kind of mishap. However, he got out on the score of 16 runs playing a drag shot, unlike his usual style. By the end of the tenth over, India had accomplished 40% of the target with a brisk pace of 8 runs per over. Despite, Shreyas Iyer not being in the best of form, the senior campaigner Rohit Sharma milked the ballers for boundaries and never let the pressure rise on Iyer. He completed his fifty in just 36 balls, allowing India’s number 4 Iyer time to set himself up and spend some time on the pitch to boast his confidence for upcoming matches. As India was cruising toward the target, Pakistani spinners looked like ordinary bowlers and gifted set Indian batters balls with boundaries written all over them. Just like the batting collapse, under pressure, the Pakistani team also displayed another facet that has become a definition trait of their side, dismal fielding. When victory and his century were in sight, Rohit Sharma got deceived by a slower ball by Shaheen Afridi and the inspired bowling change gave Pakistan a last reason to rejoice. But by then, skipper Rohit Sharma had taken India to a commanding position from where KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer nudged India to victory with risk-free singles and doubles. Apart from two aerial sixes, Shreyas Iyer kept the ball on the carpet and completed his gritty fifty taking India across the finish line.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

As Israel continues hitting Hamas targets in Gaza and preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza City in retaliation for the horrific terror attack on Israel by Hamas on 7 October, an important meeting of the OIC nations has been called. Saudi Arabia has called the meeting of the foreign ministers of the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, popularly known as OIC, which is scheduled to be held on 18 October in Jeddah. The official notification was released on 14 October. The statement read, “At the invitation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which chairs the current session of the Islamic Summit and the Executive Committee of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the Organisation’s Executive Committee is convening an urgent open-ended extraordinary meeting at the ministerial level to address the escalating military situation in Gaza and its environs as well as the deteriorating conditions that endanger the lives of civilians and the overall security and stability of the region.”It further added, “The extraordinary meeting of the Executive Committee of the OIC will take place on Wednesday, October 18, 2023, at the General Secretariat headquarters in Jeddah Governorate.”The group of Muslim nations has repeatedly condemned the Jewish state for its retaliation after the gruesome 7 October attack by the Hamas terrorists which ended up in the murder of at least 1300 Israelis including the elderly, women and children and wounding multiple others. The terror outfit also took some hostages which consisted of children. Around 1900 Palestinians have died and thousands of people have been injured in Israeli strikes. The total number of deaths on both sides is at least 3,200. Israel’s military has ordered the Gaza residents to leave the northern Gaza Strip for the southern region as the country is gearing up for a ground invasion whereas Hamas has told them to remain there.

62,"14 October, 2023 ",Israel will suffer huge earthquake: Longtime Hamas ally Iran warns that conflict may spread to other parts of Middle East if Hezbollah joins the war," The thrat by Iran came ever after the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah had been cautioned by the United States and its allies against escalating the conflict in Israel.As Israel continues its massive counterattacks on Gaza as a stern response to the destruction the Hamas terrorists have caused on Israeli soil, Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian has called on Israel to stop its actions in Gaza. With the Israeli government showing no intention to back out, the foreign minister of Iran, the longtime ally of the Islamist terrorist organisation Hamas, warned that the conflict may spread to other parts of the Middle East if Hezbollah joins the war and that would cause a “huge earthquake” for Israel.Hossein Amirabdollahian while speaking to the media in Beirut said that the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has considered every potential scenario of conflict and that Israel should stop its attacks on Gaza as soon as possible.The statement of Iran’s foreign minister came in the backdrop of his meeting with Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Friday. The Iranian minister and Nasrallah, according to the local media Al-Mayadeen, discussed the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamad. Iran, the all-weather ally of Hamas, lauded the Islamist terrorist organisation’s strike on Israel while denying any involvement.Hezbollah is a highly trained, well-armed and sophisticated military force that also receives Iranian support, so its entry into the conflict would mark a significant escalation. It may be recalled that on October 11 reports emerged which said that the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah had been cautioned by the United States and its allies against escalating the conflict in Israel. A message was reportedly sent to Hezbollah to stay out of the conflict through a number of channels, including the Lebanese government and the Hezbollah-allied Speaker of Lebanon’s Parliament, Nabih Berri.US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had ordered the deployment of a carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean in large part as a message to Hezbollah and its Iranian backers to refrain from entering the war. President Joe Biden reinforced that message in remarks on Tuesday (October 10) from the White House.Additionally, on Israel’s request, France has also conveyed to Hezbollah that they must stay out of the war and not escalate further or Israel will respond significantly.The warnings came after the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) took to X earlier on Tuesday, October 10 to inform how an anti-tank missile was launched from Lebanon towards a military post near the community of Arab Al-Aramshe on Monday (October 9).According to the Israel Defense Forces, 15 rockets were fired at the Western Galilee from Lebanon, activating sirens in a number of villages. The Iron Dome air defence system was able to stop four rockets, and the remaining eight landed in open spaces without inflicting any harm or injuries, according to the IDF.A senior Israel Defence Forces (IDF) officer and two soldiers were killed during a firefight with terrorists who infiltrated into Israeli territory from southern Lebanon on Monday afternoon, the military confirmed on Tuesday. Five additional Israeli troops were wounded in the attack, according to the IDF.In response to the rocket attack, Israel launched artillery strikes and shelled two posts belonging to the Hezbollah terror group.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

63,"14 October, 2023 ",Israel-Hamas War: Australia cancels two scheduled evacuation flights as the crisis deteriorates," The two scheduled flights were called off and Australia echoed the Joe Biden administration's request for Israel to respond to Hamas strikes in accordance with the laws of war and pledged an additional $10 million in humanitarian aid for Gaza's civilian population. Due to mounting concerns about the potential for increased violence in the area, two scheduled flights to evacuate Australians stuck in Israel and Palestine have been cancelled. However, the government of Anthony Albanese claimed it is working on other possibilities to bring the individuals to safety. A “highly challenging and rapidly changing” situation has forced the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) to put off the scheduled repatriation flights for this weekend. “The situation is highly challenging and rapidly changing. Unfortunately, we have been advised our scheduled flights will not depart Israel today. A further flight will not depart as scheduled tomorrow.”Australia is still helping local residents get home and it will keep them informed about upcoming flights, per the department. Over 200 Australians and their families reportedly made it to London at 9 pm local time (7 am Australian Eastern Daylight Time) on 14 October safely as the first of a scheduled series of repatriation flights took off on 13 October local time.The two scheduled flights were called off and Australia echoed the Joe Biden administration’s request for Israel to respond to Hamas strikes in accordance with the laws of war and pledged an additional $10 million in humanitarian aid for Gaza’s civilian population. Prior to an anticipated ground assault of the blockaded strip, thousands of civilians have begun escaping to Gaza’s southern half. According to Qantas Airlines, evacuation flights from Tel Aviv have been halted as a result of advice over the growing threat on the ground.More than 800 Australians have managed to leave Israel since the start of the war, including on Qantas flights to London, per Australia’s foreign minister Penny Wong, who stated on the evening of 14 October, “But I know that there are many more people who are seeking to leave and I can assure you that the government and officials are working as hard as they can to arrange flights and to get flights in.”She conveyed, “850 previously registered Australians and their families have now left Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories. DFAT is assisting more than 1,500 registered Australians in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. Not all of those are looking to leave.”She proclaimed, “The situation on the ground is obviously very volatile, and it is changing rapidly. I spent a lot of time on the phones today to see if there was any way we could find alternatives, and I understand how distressing this is for people.” “Qantas has been running constant safety assessments for its planned flights to Tel Aviv in consultation with government agencies. Based on the latest assessments, the difficult decision has been made not to operate the second flight to Tel Aviv on Sunday due to continued deterioration of conditions on the ground in Israel for safety reasons,” a spokesperson for Qantas said in a statement.Meanwhile, the minister raised alarm about the worsening conditions in Gaza before the government officially announced that the two scheduled flights had been cancelled. The US president, Joe Biden stressed earlier in the day that it was important to “urgently address the humanitarian crisis” in Gaza. He asserted, “We can’t lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas and Hamas’s appalling attacks, and they’re suffering as a result as well.”She expressed similar fears. Australia’s foreign minister observed, “President Biden has called on Israel to operate by the rules of war in its response to Hamas attacks, we join him and others in that call.” She further noted, “We call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to civilians affected by the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and we call for the establishment of a corridor to enable humanitarian needs to be met. Adherence to international humanitarian law must be prioritised, including the protection of civilians, wherever they live.”The Australian government is donating $3 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross in order to restore basic services and $7 million via the UN in order to finance emergency services for child safety, nutrition, sanitation and hygiene. The government is going to “continue to monitor and assess the humanitarian situation and stands ready to provide further support,” she added.Interestingly, in the midst of the violent struggle with Hamas, the US State Department had also established evacuation plans to assist Americans in leaving Israel and asked the ones seeking aid to leave the Jewish state to complete a “crisis intake form” and “sign an agreement to repay the US government prior to departure” as required by the country’s law.Notably, India has launched ‘Operation Ajay’ to ensure the safe return of Indians stranded in the war-inflicted region. As many as 447 Indian people who ended up stranded in the midst of the fierce Israel-Hamas confrontation have been brought back to India. On 13 October, the inaugural aircraft with 212 Indian passengers touched down in Delhi while the second flight had 235 Indian nationals. Those who returned expressed their gratitude to the Indian government.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

64,"14 October, 2023 ",Australia rejects historic referendum to recognise Indigenous People in the Constitution," According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the states of New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, and South Australia have rejected the amendment which would have established an Indigenous committee to advise Parliament and the government on issues affecting the Indigenous people— Australia's most disadvantaged ethnic minority.On Saturday, 14th October, Australia voted to reject the proposal to recognise Indigenous people in the constitution. The development is seen as a major setback to the country’s efforts to reunite with its First Peoples.The referendum is centred around the acknowledgement of indigenous Australians within the nation’s Constitution and the establishment of an indigenous advisory body known as the “Voice to Parliament” to provide guidance to lawmakers on issues affecting their well-being. The existing 122-year-old Constitution of Australia does not include any reference to the Aboriginal people.According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the states of New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, and South Australia have rejected the amendment which would have established an Indigenous committee to advise Parliament and the government on issues affecting the Indigenous people— Australia’s most disadvantaged ethnic minority.Meanwhile, the latest reports say that all six states have rejected the Indigenous referendum. The only region expected to vote Yes on the reform is Australia’s Capital Territory, which includes the capital Canberra. Territories, on the other hand, are not state votes and solely count towards the national vote.To get approved, the referendum required the vote of at least four of the six states, as well as a national majority. According to reports, advocates of constitutional change conceded defeat within minutes of the projection.The voters were asked one question for the referendum to which they had to answer in “yes” or “no”. The question was: “A Proposed Law: to alter the Constitution to recognise the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. Do you approve this proposed alteration?”Following the referendum’s defeat, the Australian Prime Minister addressed the nation and said that regardless of the win or defeat, he had given his word to the Indigenous Australians to hold a referendum.“My fellow Australians, at the outset, I want to say that while tonight’s result is not one that I had hoped for, I absolutely respect the decision of the Australian people. And I say to the millions of Australians, all over our great country that voted yes with hope and goodwill and it will not divide us,” a visibly disheartened prime minister said.“We are not yes voters or no voters. We are all Australian. We must take our country beyond this debate, without forgetting while we had it in the first place,” PM Albanese continued.The Australian Prime Minister also mentioned the 2017 Uluru Statement, a document that stated the decision to have a referendum on creating an Indigenous Voice advisory body to Parliament, as he urged the pro-referendum people to accept the results with grace and humility.“Just as the Uluru Statement from the Heart was an invitation extended with humility, grace and optimism for the future, tonight we must meet this result with the same grace and humility. And tomorrow we must seek a new way forward with the same optimism.”Taking to X, Prime Minister Albanese posted, “Together we must take our country beyond this debate – without forgetting why we had it in the first place. Because a great nation like ours can and must do better for the First Australians. Our government will continue to listen to people and to communities.”Together we must take our country beyond this debate – without forgetting why we had it in the first place. Because a great nation like ours can and must do better for the First Australians.Our government will continue to listen to people and to communities. pic.twitter.com/3IMTkkTlG1One of the Voice advocates Tanya Hosch, who spent a decade developing the model said, “On a personal level, I feel devastated. here’s going to be a lot of pain and hurt and dismay and we’re going to need to take a moment to absorb that message and what it says.”Another Voice advocate while expressing his disappointment over the voting results blamed the alleged “unfair attacks on the campaign” for its failure.Meanwhile, opposition leader Peter Dutton said that any proposal which divided Australians into distinct categories would be rejected by the people.“One of the great attributes of the Australian public is that we all see ourselves as equal. It doesn’t matter if you came six months ago, or 60 years ago, or have 65,000 years of ancestry in this country. Australians are all equal. I think the Australian public rejected the proposition to divide us on the basis of ancestry or race and that is a great thing for our country. We shouldn’t shy away from that. Our nation’s rulebook is incredibly important. It underpins the success of our country.”The term ‘aboriginal‘ refers to Australia’s original inhabitants, who lived on the Australian mainland and nearby islands for many thousands of years prior to the arrival of the first Europeans in the early 17th century.Ironically, the 122-year-old Australian Constitution makes no mention of Aboriginals. Aboriginal people account for around 3.2% of Australia’s population and consistently perform below national averages on most socioeconomic measures. According to the Australian government, indigenous Australians have an 8-year lower life expectancy than non-Indigenous Australians. Increased disease and infant mortality. Suicide rates are twice as high among Indigenous Australians as among non-Indigenous Australians.Supporters of the Voice proposal opined that incorporating an Indigenous advisory body into the constitution would assist in addressing some of the issues they experience, such as lower life expectancy and a considerably higher incarceration rate.The main opposition to the proposal has stated that the Voice would be divisive and that its powers are not well defined. Meanwhile, some Indigenous opponents say that the proposal is unsatisfactory and have called for a treaty instead.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

65,"14 October, 2023 ","Hamas is a terrorist group, its only agenda is to destroy Israel and murder Jews: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken"," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Hamas is not a representative of the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations for the future.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that Hamas is a terrorist group and its only agenda is to destroy Israel and murder Jews. He said the group is not a representative of the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations for the future.“Hamas is not a representative of the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations for the future. Hamas is a terrorist group and its only agenda is to destroy Israel and murder Jews. And it is important that the entire world sees it as such. This is an important moment for more clarity when it comes to Hamas,” the US State Secretary said during a meeting with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal Bin Farhan.Blinken further said that no country can or should be expected to tolerate what Israel has just been on the receiving end of, which is an attack that also defies description in words, in which 1300 of its people were slaughtered along with the nationals of more than 30 other countries by Hamas.Blinken is on a visit to Israel, Jordan, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt from October 11-15 to meet with senior officials and reiterate his condemnation of the terrorist attacks in Israel, reaffirming the United States’ solidarity with the government and people of Israel, as per a release issued by the US State Department.Meanwhile, the Saudi Foreign Minister said the primary sufferers of the Israel-Palestine conflict “are civilians, civilian population on both sides…I think we all condemn the targeting of civilians in any form, at any time and by anyone…The priority now needs to be to stop further civilian suffering…”He said: “We need to find a way to quickly de-escalate the situation (Israel-Palestine conflict)…at least stopping the guns and working towards addressing the cause of humanitarian challenges. I have to emphasise that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is very difficult. We need to work together to make sure that access to humanitarian relief is allowed…We need to work together to find a way out of the cycle of violence…”Earlier, Blinken said that efforts to bring humanitarian aid to Gaza have been “complicated” as terrorist group Hamas continues to use civilians as “human shields” and is reportedly blocking roads to prevent Palestinians from relocating to southern Gaza.Terming the humanitarian situation as “urgent” Blinken added that the US is actively engaged with its partners, including Qatar to provide humanitarian aid to those who are in need. He noted that Israel is carrying out operations in Gaza as Hamas carried out terrorist attacks that killed 1,300 Israelis in the “most horrific way.”Taking to X, after a meeting with Qatari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Blinken tweeted, “Met with Qatar’s Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs @MBA_AlThani_ about the terrorist attacks in Israel and work to prevent the conflict from spreading.”Addressing a joint press briefing with Sheikh Mohammed after the meeting, Blinken said, “Israel is conducting operations in Gaza because Hamas carried out terrorist attacks that killed – in the most horrific – way 1,300 of its people. Hamas terrorists slaughtered, raped, mutilated, tortured, burned innocent civilians – from babies to the elderly, men, women, boys, and girls,” he said.“Now, efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza are complicated by the fact that Hamas continues to use innocent civilians as human shields, and is reportedly blocking roads to prevent Palestinians from moving to southern Gaza, out of harm’s way. We know the humanitarian situation is urgent,” the US Secretary said.“We’re actively engaged with partners, including Qatar, to get aid to those who need it,” Blinken said.Meanwhile, Israeli troops are mobilizing towards Gaza. Aerial patrolling is also being sent at the Gaza border.It was recently reported that Israeli soldiers, their tanks and munitions have been deployed near the Gaza border as they prepare for a full ground offensive against Hamas.In the pictures coming in from the Gaza border, tanks can be seen firing shells towards the Gaza Strip. Moreover, soldiers are seen loading artillery shells into howitzers.Earlier in the day, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) asked residents of the Northern Gaza Strip to relocate to the southern part of the enclave using evacuation corridors between 10 am to 4 pm (local time), The Times of Israel reported.The Israeli military said, “If you care about yourself and your loved ones, go south as instructed.” It further said, “Rest assured that Hamas leaders have taken care of themselves and are taking cover from strikes in the region.”Their message indicated that the IDF could be readying to launch a ground invasion in response to Hamas’s attack on October 7.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

In the video footage, armed terrorists can be seen firing indiscriminately at makeshift toilets at the music festival where thousands of unsuspecting Israeli and foreign nationals had gathered to celebrate the Jewish festivities of Sukkot. The visuals that have emerged from the video footage recorded during the ghastly terror attack speak about the harrowing experience of the partygoers. WATCH Hamas terrorists indiscriminately shoot at bathrooms during the Nova Music Festival.

They had arrived in vehicles at the site of the Nova music festival near Reim in Israel. Seconds later, one terrorist starts pacing down the row of portable toilets, waving his rifle and intermittently firing a single round through each of the closed doors. He can be seen indiscriminately shooting at closed doors of the toilets with the clear intention of killing anyone hiding in those toilets to save their lives. The terrorist shows no remorse, no emotion, and does not even seem to notice or care if anyone is inside those toilets.

Some unconfirmed videos of such music festivals later surfaced online in which Hamas terrorists were seen in backdrop paragliding. The survivors spoke about the terrifying ordeal that included the rape of women, abduction, and merciless murders at the hands of Hamas terrorists. As per media reports, over 260 dead bodies were recovered at the festival site during the clearance operations while many of the partygoers were reportedly missing. Notably, the lifeless and naked body of the German tourist later identified as Shani Louk, was paraded and spat on by Hamas terrorists following the attack on the Nova Music festival.

The matter is presently underway in court. Villagers said that they placed the deity there for worship a while back because it is Panchayat property. However, the opposing side did not like this. They regularly threatened to remove the idol and issued a similar warning on 13 October. The local residents charged that they were the ones who committed the crime.As soon as the information was received, DSP Sonu Narwal rushed to the area with a large police presence and pacified the populace. The fragments of the idol were discovered and later some more parts were recovered close to a neighbouring pond.According to the official, the locals have filed a police complaint and accused the idol was shattered by members of the other side. He proclaimed that every facet of this case is being extensively investigated by the police and assured that the accused who broke the idol would soon be in custody.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Israeli casualties have surpassed 1,300 while more than 1,900 Palestinians have been reportedly killed in Gaza. Israel’s military has ordered its citizens to evacuate the northern Gaza Strip to the south and Israel appeared to be preparing a ground offensive while the terror outfit urged residents to stay put. According to the United Nations humanitarian organisation’s OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs), tens of thousands of civilians moved southward in Gaza after the Jewish state issued a 24-hour evacuation order for the northern parts of the territory. The latest information has put the number at 400,000. The Israeli military announced on 13 October that it was conducting brief raids in Gaza to target terrorists, however, it clarified that this did not indicate the start of a ground invasion. Over 70 individuals died, per the propaganda office of Hamas, when aeroplanes attacked trucks travelling south. Many protests ensued throughout the Middle East, particularly in Jordan and Bahrain, which attracted large crowds to show their support. The Palestinian representative to the United Nations appealed to Secretary-General António Guterres to act swiftly amid this crisis and described the ongoing events as a “crime against humanity.”Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the president of Egypt, emphasised the significance of the Palestinian people’s unwavering presence in their homeland as neighbouring Arab states rejected the request for safe passage for Palestinians from Gaza.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the creation of protected zones in Gaza to ease the relocation of civilians. Meanwhile, the first charter flight coordinated by the US State Department to transport Americans out of Israel landed in Athens on 13 October. President Joe Biden stressed the importance of resolving the humanitarian crisis in Gaza while reiterating his commitment to ensuring the safe release of any Americans taken hostage by Hamas. The Israeli military remained on high alert in anticipation of a possible escalation in the West Bank and was stated to have struck a Hezbollah target in southern Lebanon in reaction to the entry of unidentified aircraft objects into its territory.Notably, a number of US financial institutions and technology corporations have addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict and some have even started fund-raising campaigns for Israeli casualties.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The video titled “Soham Papoor NOT A R0@$T video” and captioned, “No hate is intended for the parties involved in the video, all references and commentary is meant for lighthearted entertainment only,” was posted 5 months ago.

Kindly delete the reported link and ensure that you do not allow your platform to be used for the mentioned activities,” it added.The notice further read that they have tasked an Online Reputation Management (ORM) solution provider “to undertake all activities & actions over the Internet to engage and neutralize fake profiles created in the names of our family members, illegal rumours, misquote in interviews, photos, comments personal information uploaded on social media, defamatory comments, trolls, concocted stories, gossips, negative news and negative review about our fashion brands and businesses that would be potential targets for sabotage across the Internet”. The YouTuber was also warned in the notice that Sonam Kapoor may take “necessary action to safeguard her reputation” if she fails to comply with the directions.After being threatened with a legal notice, the Youtuber took to her Instagram account to share a copy of the legal notice with a caption, “Bro has lost his mind over one video.” In her Instagram story she called the legal notice a ‘letter of show off.’In the Instagram story she also stated that they wanted her to “remove the video”. However, Instagram later removed the original screenshot of her first Instagram post on this particular fiasco, which had been captioned as “Bro has lost his mind over one video.”  The YouTuber, then on October 12, uploaded a video on her YouTube channel in response to a legal notice titled “She Who Must Not Be Named.” In the video she yet again roasted the actor and her husband for using the wrong gender while addressing her.

I have defended Sonam more than I insulted her in that video,” she said. When Raginyy got the email, she had 6,000 subscribers on YouTube. She claimed that she lacked the time and resources necessary to respond to the notice from such a powerful person. This video which she also shared on her Instagram account with a caption, “Thousands of hate accounts on insta, hundreds of borderline cyber bullying r0@$ts on YouTube, hundreds of subreddit posts dedicated to saying the most unhinged things about you and a video with 4k views is what you wanna take down?

Israeli Ambassador, Rafi Harpaz, had a telephone conversation with the Chinese envoy to the Middle East regarding Beijing’s decision not to condemn the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel.During his conversation with the Chinese government’s special envoy for the Middle East issue, Israeli Ambassador Harpaz stated that Israel is ‘deeply disappointed’ with China’s statements and media reports on the horrific incidents that took place in southern Israel, as informed by the Israeli Embassy in China on X.昨天，受以色列外交部长埃利•科亨指示，以色列外交部亚太事务副总司长兼大使拉菲•哈帕兹同中国政府中东问题特使翟隽通话。…In their official statement informing about the telephone conversation, the Embassy highlighted that China neither condemned the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas nor mentioned Israel’s right to defend itself and its citizens against such brutal attacks. The Embassy wrote, “There was no clear and unequivocal condemnation of the terrorist attacks and vicious massacres carried out by the terrorist organisation Hamas against innocent civilians, as well as the kidnapping of dozens of people into the Gaza Strip. Nor is there any mention of Israel’s right to defend itself and its citizens, which is a fundamental right of any sovereign state in the face of a brutal attack that is unprecedented and intolerable to human society.” The Israeli Embassy further noted that China’s statement was “inconsistent with and untrue to the tragedies and fears that have occurred in the past few days.”Israeli statement calling out China for siding with Hamas comes in the wake of a Chinese statement that was issued earlier this week on 9th October. Addressing media over the Israel-Hamas war, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that it wouldn’t condemn Palestine despite certain voices ‘pressurising’ it to do so following the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel. The spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to explicitly call out Hamas terrorists or Islamist outfits in Gaza for launching a surprise attack on Israeli citizens in the early hours of 7th October.Chinese FM spokesperson Mao Ning also downplayed the terrorist attacks and ground invasion by Hamas inside Israeli territories and claimed that China condemns any “behaviour” that is “harmful” to civilians. Stating that it is “highly concerned” about the Israel-Hamas war, Mao Ning added that China opposes the escalation of the situation.  While all major non-Arab countries highlighted that Israel has the right to defend itself against such terrorist attacks, the Chinese Foreign Ministry advised Israel and Gaza to indulge in peace talks. The Chinese FM said that China believes dialogues and negotiations are the fundamental way out of conflicts. It urged all parties to reach a ceasefire to avoid an escalation of the situation.Meanwhile, on 13th October, an Israeli diplomat was brutally stabbed multiple times in Beijing. The staffer is receiving medical treatment at a hospital and is stable. According to i24News, this was a “possible terrorist attack”. According to a post by Swarajya on X, the attack was not close to the Israeli embassy. The attacker’s motive is under investigation.🔴 Israeli diplomat stabbed in Beijing -Attack not close to embassy-Attacker motive being probed-Comes as Hamas calls for ""day of rage""https://t.co/yIZiPv8qJXA purported video of the attack also went viral on the internet. The video showed the attacker, dressed in a white shirt, armed with what appears to be a long knife. The video further showed the attacker stabbing the diplomat at least 5 times aiming at his throat and coming repeatedly at him while the diplomat tried to fight the attacker off.The ongoing Israel-Hamas war which has entered the eighth day has divided the countries the world over into two distinct camps with one clearly calling out Hamas terrorist attacks and taking measures to curb support for the terrorist organisation while others like China have sided with Hamas concocting it as an ordinary geopolitical issue/conflict.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

At the same time, they were heard raising slogans of ‘Intifada Inquilab.’ The Hamas supporters were part of the Students Islamic Organisation (SIO) of India, which is the student wing of the radical Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. The development was confirmed on X (formerly Twitter) by Swarajya journalist Swati Goel Sharma.

76,"14 October, 2023 ","Hamas starts propaganda after massacring innocent Israelis, releases video of terrorists showing ‘compassion’ for children held hostage"," The video  was released by Hamas on their Telegram channel with the caption, ""Hamas fighters, showing compassion for children in the midst of the Kibbutz 'Holet' battles on day one of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.""On Friday (13th October), Palestinian terrorist group Hamas released a disturbing video of Israeli children kidnapped by them. In an apparent effort to build a narrative about how the terrorists treat hostages, the video shows armed terrorists playing with and clutching kidnapped Israeli children.Reportedly, the video  was released by Hamas on their Telegram channel with the caption, “Hamas fighters, showing compassion for children in the midst of the Kibbutz ‘Holet’ battles on day one of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.”The video is a compilation of video clips purportedly showing Hamas members being “compassionate.” In the beginning, a Hamas terrorist is seen wrapping a bandage around the foot of an Israeli child. The following clips show another terrorist holding a kid in his arms, patting them on the back, and saying something.BREAKING: Hamas released on Friday footage of terrorists holding Israeli toddlers and children on Saturday, during the mass infiltration and massacre of Israelis. pic.twitter.com/IhDU6U1ubHThe child can be heard wailing in a video of a terrorist swaying a small child back and forth in a pram. The video’s last shot depicts a toddler clutching a cup of water. A person instructs the child in English to “say ‘bismillah’ (in the name of Allah).” The child repeats “Bismillah” and takes a sip.Ironically, while Hamas is releasing such propaganda videos to garner support and sympathy it had declared Friday (13th October) as a day of “Global Jihad”. Hamas urged Muslims across the world to observe Friday Namaz as a ‘day of rage’ and ‘day of jihad’ against Israel. While Hamas is killing Israeli people, taking them hostage, raping women and inflicting atrocities beyond imagination, many of their supporters/sympathisers globally are harassing Jewish people, particularly Jewish students.The propaganda videos of Hamas cannot hide the fact that they have killed over 1,300 people, including children and the elderly, and injured more than 2,000 others. Hamas’s attempt to appear ‘humane’ fell flat as the terrorist group launched an attack on innocent Jews observing their holiday of Simchat Torah last Saturday. Hamas’s offensive prompted Israel to launch “Operation Iron Swords”. Since then, Israel in their retaliatory action has been striking Hamas targets, eliminating Hamas terrorists. Moreover, Israel has also cut power and water supply to Gaza, along with stopping supplies from entering the landlocked coastal strip.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

77,"14 October, 2023 ",India vs Pakistan: Will India be able to maintain its unbeaten streak against Pakistan in ODI World Cups and make it 8-0," The Indian side would like to repeat its previous performance and take the lead in the World Cups to 8-0 and secure a position in the knockouts. On 14th October (Saturday), the biggest cricketing rivalry between India and Pakistan is back in action. As the ‘Men in Blue’ will step on the field, they will aim to advance their winning streak against their archrivals in the ODI World Cup. With an impressive 7-0 record in head-to-head matchups against Pakistan in ODI World Cups, the host, India, stands as the clear favourites, having never lost to Pakistan in ODI World Cup.  Notably, the most recent clash in the longer format of White ball cricket took place in Manchester during the 2019 World Cup in England where India pulled off a convincing victory against Pakistan. Now, let’s take a closer look at these historic encounters between both teams, matches that can rival even the most famous sporting rivalries, such as the ‘El Clásico’. The Indian cricketing side was up against their arch-rivals Pakistan for the first time at an ODI World Cup in the 1992 edition in Sydney. Led by then-skipper Mohammad Azharuddin, India chose to bat first in the game and utilised the pressure of runs on the board.With the help of gritty innings by Ajay Jadeja (46 runs in 77 balls) and Sachin Tendulkar (unbeaten 54 runs) India set a decent target of 217 runs for the Pakistani side to chase. But during the second half, Indian bowlers went on a rampage, bundling up Pakistan for 173 runs to clinch a 43 runs victory and kick start a winning streak that is continuing to date.Contrary to present times where camaraderie has overshadowed and fizzled out the on-field passionate rivalry from the Indian side, India-Pakistan World Cup encounters have witnessed to major on-field feuds which had reinvigorated the fans and players alike during the mega clash. One such rivalry unfolded in the 1996 World Cup match played in Bangalore. After batting first, the Indian side piled up a mammoth total of 287 runs courtesy of a brilliant 90-run partnership between Navjot Singh Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar which was backed up by Ajay Jadeja’s blistering 45 runs in 25 balls. Pakistan had a brisk start as Aamer Sohail smashed 55 runs while Saeed Answar added 48 runs. However, afterwards, the fans witnessed one of the finest comebacks in personal tussles as Venkatesh Prasad replied sharply to Aamir Sohail’s gesture with the bat arrogantly showing him the boundary. Letting the ball do the talking, Prasad removed the timber opening the gates of yet another victory for India at the World Cups. With a combined six wickets among Venkatesh Prasad and Anil Kumble, India won the match comfortably by 39 runs.India completed their winning hatrick in the 1999 clash as Mohammad Azharuddin-led India handed over a drubbing to Pakistan. Thanks to the fifties from Rahul Dravid and Mohammad Azharuddin, India registered a total of 227. However, in the second innings, Venkatesh Prasad again went on a rampage and completed a five-wicket haul to decimate the Pakistani batting line up and sealed India a 47-run victory.Unlike previous encounters, this time it was Pakistan who piled up a big total on the scoreboard. Pakistani opener Saeed Anwar smashed a scintillating century against India to set a high target of 273 runs for the Indian side to chase. However, the young Indian turks led by new captain Sourav Ganguly again proved to be better side. With Sachin Tendulkar’s pacy innings of 98 runs in only 75 balls and an unbeaten 50 runs from Yuvraj Singh, India won the game by six wickets.In 2011, cricketing rivals India and Pakistan were up against each other for the fifth time. This was the first time both sides were competing in a knockout game, the high-octane semi-final. In his last World Cup, Sachin Tendulkar again produced a majestic innings as he scored 85 runs to take India to a total of 259 runs.In the second innings, all Indian bowlers chipped in and picked two wickets a piece to secure a 29-run victory. The Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side later prevailed over Sri Lanka in the final to clinch their second-ever World Cup trophy. The defending champion, India, was up against formidable Pakistan in their sixth World Cup clash. In this clash, it was time for the run-machine Virat Kohli to shine as he rose to the occasion and scored a scintillating century. This took the Indian side beyond the 300-run barrier for the first time against Pakistan at a World Cup encounter despite Sohail Khan’s five-wicket haul.In the second innings, Pakistani batters were no match to the Indian bowling side and Mohammad Shami took four wickets to end Pakistan’s batting at 224 runs to secure another convincing win. Manchester again proved to be a happy hunting ground for India as Indian skipper Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma took the game right away from the grip of Pakistan. Rohit with his brilliant century (140 runs in 113 balls) and Virat’s 77, helped India again breach the 300-run mark and pose a total of 336/5 in their 50-over quota. In the rain-curtailed match, the Pakistani side had no answers to India’s bowling triad of Vijay Shankar, Hardik Pandya and Kuldeep Yadav. Together they took six wickets in the second innings and secured an 89-run win for the nation advancing India’s winning streak to 7-0 against their arch-rival Pakistan. The Indian side would like to repeat its previous performance and take the lead in the World Cups to 8-0 and secure a position in the knockouts. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

79,"14 October, 2023 ",Many Palestinian civilians moving south: Israeli military after issuing evacuation orders to Gaza City inhabitants," Israel has warned 1.1 million in north Gaza including Gaza City to move to the south of Wadi Gaza within 24 hoursA day after instructing inhabitants of Gaza City to evacuate to the south of the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military reported on 14 October that it had observed “significant movement” of Palestinian people in the south as Israel’s prime minister warned additional reprisal for Hamas’ assault last week.As Palestinians confined in Gaza dealt with a power outage, a scarcity of food and water and ferocious Israeli bombing, United States President Joe Biden stressed that discussions with regional governments about the humanitarian catastrophe were ongoing.Israel has pledged to completely destroy Hamas in retaliation for the onslaught on 7 October in which its assailants slaughtered at least 1,300 Israelis, primarily civilians, and took several captives. Israel has presently completely besieged and pounded the 2.3 million-person-strong Gaza Strip which is governed by Hamas with unparalleled airstrikes. It has led to the deaths of 1,900 individuals, according to authorities in Gaza. Israel issued a warning to over a million northern people on 13 October asking them to leave the region within 24 hours, however, the deadline expired at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT). In an early video briefing, Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus informed, “We have seen a significant movement of Palestinian civilians towards the south.” The time limit frame was not mentioned by him and he also declined to address questions.He further added, “Around the Gaza Strip, Israeli reserve soldiers in formation are getting ready for the next stage of operations. They are all around the Gaza Strip, in the south, in the centre and in the north, and they are preparing themselves for whatever target they get, whatever task. The end state of this war is that we will dismantle Hamas and its military capability and fundamentally change the situation so that Hamas never again has the ability to inflict any damage on Israeli civilians or soldiers.”Hamas urged locals to remain and threatened to fight to the death. The first formal mention of ground forces in Gaza since the crisis began, an Israeli military spokesperson said on 13 October that raids with tank support had been launched to target Palestinian rocket crews and acquire intelligence on the whereabouts of hostages.“We are striking our enemies with unprecedented might. I emphasise that this is only the beginning,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu highlighted in a rare statement transmitted on television after the Jewish Sabbath began on 13 October. According to the United Nations, more than 400,000 Palestinians had already been internally displaced because of hostilities before the Israeli order and tens of thousands of Palestinians are believed to have moved from northern Gaza after the decree. However, many more declared they would not leave. “Death is better than leaving,” exclaimed 20-year-old Mohammad, outside a structure that had been destroyed by an Israeli airstrike close to the centre of Gaza.“Hold on to your homes. Hold on to your land,” broadcast mosques in their message. As a result of the forced displacement of so many people, the United Nations and other organisations have warned of disaster and advocated the lifting of the siege to allow relief to enter. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced, “We need immediate humanitarian access throughout Gaza, so that we can get fuel, food and water to everyone in need. Even wars have rules,” on 13 October.Speaking at a Philadelphia cargo terminal, Joe Biden remarked that solving the humanitarian problem was of the utmost importance. He revealed that American teams in the area were cooperating with Israel, Egypt, Jordan and other Arab nations, along with the U.N. “The overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas and Hamas’ appalling attacks. And they’re suffering as a result as well.”Israel reprimanded the U.N. for failing to criticize Hamas and support Israel’s right to self-defence after U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric argued that following the country’s command to leave Gaza would have “devastating humanitarian consequences.”“The noose around the civilian population in Gaza is tightening. How are 1.1 million people supposed to move across a densely populated war zone in less than 24 hours,” questioned Martin Griffiths, the head of the United Nations relief efforts on social media. The forcible eviction would be a replay of the 1948 expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from what is now Israel, based on Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, a rival organisation to Hamas. The majority of Gazans are descendants of these exiles.There is currently no route out of Gaza which is one of the most populated areas on earth. Egypt has opposed requests to open its border with the region in addition to Israel’s blockade. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met on 13 October. The latter highlighted that although the Jewish country was receiving military assistance, it was time for resolution rather than retaliation. The former commented, “The path will be long, but ultimately I promise you we will win.” On 13 October, United States Secretary of State Anthony Blinken met with King Abdullah and Mahmoud Abbas in Jordan. The Palestinian Authority, which he leads, has ceded control of Gaza to Hamas since 2007 but still retains some measure of autonomy in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Later, the US official took a plane to Qatar, a U.S. ally with clout among Islamist groups.Israeli security forces and pro-Gaza activists engaged in gunfights in the West Bank and authorities in Palestine reported 16 shooting deaths. Furthermore, there have been concerns about hostilities extending, particularly to Israel’s northern border with Lebanon where this week’s skirmishes have already claimed the most lives since 2006.According to a second Reuters videographer on the scene, Israeli rockets killed Reuters video journalist Issam Abdallah on 13 October while he was filming in southern Lebanon. Another six journalists suffered injuries. The occurrence was linked to Israel by the Hezbollah congressman and the prime minister of Lebanon, Najob Mikati. Israel’s representative to the U.N. announced that it would look into what had transpired there. Envoy Gilad Erdan observed, “We always try to mitigate and avoid civilian casualties. Obviously, we would never want to hit or kill or shoot any journalist that is doing its job.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Over the following days, the fate of her parents remained uncertain, fueling concerns that they might have been abducted and taken to Gaza.However, just before her conversation with CNN, Keren received the heartbreaking update of her mother and father’s passing. She expressed relief knowing that her parents had passed away swiftly, providing them a relatively painless end.Cindy, originally from St. Paul, Minnesota, relocated to Israel many years ago after being captivated by the country during a visit, as reported by USA Today. She tied the knot with Igal, an Israeli citizen, and they established their home in Kfar Azar—a community situated a short distance from the Gaza border. This community once had approximately 800 inhabitants before the tragic events of last Saturday, which witnessed the horrific loss of entire families and unspeakable violence towards infants.Keren affectionately characterised her mother as “overflowing with compassion and empathy,” highlighting her strong advocacy for the rights of Palestinians. She emphasised how her mother consistently protested during military operations, firmly believing in the equal treatment of all individuals regardless of their religious beliefs or ethnicity. Keren also shared her deep regard for her parents, describing them as some of the most exemplary individuals she has ever encountered.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

82,"14 October, 2023 ","After the terror attack that massacred hundreds of Israeli civilians, Hamas uses Israeli infants they have taken hostage to garner sympathy: Watch"," The Hamas group has circulated this propaganda video of armed men attending to Israeli infants they have held hostage on a channel in the instant messaging app Telegram.After committing unspeakable atrocities on Israeli civilians in the past one week, the Palestine Islamist terror organisation Hamas has now begun utilising Israeli infants and toddlers, which they have taken hostage, to garner sympathy. In an apparent effort to create an impression of how well the terrorist organisation is treating hostages, Hamas released a propaganda video in which armed terrorists play with and fondle Israeli infants and babies they have taken hostage after brutally killing their parents.According to the Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post, this video was recorded when the Hamas terrorists barged into Be’eri Kibbutz on the Gaza border, unsettling the peaceful existence of this close-knit community on Saturday, October 8.The Hamas group has circulated this propaganda video of armed men attending to Israeli infants they have held hostage on a channel in the instant messaging app Telegram. The official Israel Defense Forces (IDF) X account posted the video that was released by the Hamas terrorists on Telegram.You can see their injuries, hear their cries and feel them trembling from fear as these children are held hostage in their own homes by Hamas terrorists and their parents lie there dead in the next room.These are the terrorists that we are going to defeat. pic.twitter.com/myDsGnOzT1The video shows armed Hamas terrorists in tactical vests holding babies in their laps. Young Israeli children, not looking a day older than 4 to 5 years old, are shown being held by Hamas members while they sit around a table. Notably, in every clip, the Hamas terrorists have blurred their faces while leaving the faces of the innocent toddlers exposed.In one clip, a Hamas terrorist is shown carrying a crying baby, soothing him by patting his back. In another segment, one Hamas terrorist cradles a baby in one arm while holding an automatic weapon with the other. In the same video, a group of terrorists is also seen pushing a pram to pacify a crying infant.Near the end of the clip, a man wearing a balaclava and a green headband holding a child in each arm and directly addressing the camera in Arabic. The video ends with, a Hamas terrorist encouraging a child to say “Bismillah” while offering him a cup of water. The child, who looks visibly petrified, obeys and repeats what he is being asked to say. He then lifts the cup and drinks from it. This is the same toddler who appeared at the start of the video, where he was sitting on a table and crying as a Hamas terrorist bandaged his wounded ankle.Since October 7, when Hamas launched an unprecedented onslaught on Israel, the Palestinian Islamist terror group has committed horrific crimes against Israeli people, including rape, kidnapping, beheading, and barbaric killings. Umpteen videos and images have emerged depicting the extent of brutality and savagery members of the Islamist terror organisation Hamas have inflicted on Israeli civilians. Hundreds of Israeli civilians, including the elderly and infants, have fallen prey to the barbarity inflicted by the Hamas terrorists.The numerous distressing visuals that have surfaced on social media, in fact, serve as evidence that Hamas terrorists have murdered over 1300 innocent Israeli people, including women, the elderly, and newborns, by shooting, stabbing, beheading, and even burning them alive. In fact, on Thursday, October 12, the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel took the extraordinary step of releasing gruesome photos of murdered babies to reporters and the public, seeking to underscore the atrocities carried out by Hamas in its savage rampage through southern Israel on Saturday. OpIndia also listed 15 such videos showing how Hamas targeted innocent civilians and inflicted brutalities in Israel.Following all these horrifying acts of violence they have committed in the past week, the Palestinian terrorist organisation had the temerity to release such a video in order to show the world their ‘humane’ side. They should be aware, though, that most people are not gullible enough to believe their lies. The kidnapping of children during a war is one of the most heinous war crimes, according to the international community. Along with other atrocities like targeting hospitals or schools and enlisting children as soldiers, the UN has designated it as one of the six “grave violations” that it condemns.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Read details," As evident from a WhatsApp group chat shared with BBC, terrified residents of the Kibbutz communicated snippets of information, their fears, and desperate pleas for help.Terror engulfed Israel on 7th October after terrorist group Hamas launched an unforeseen attack killing innocent Israeli civilians, taking many of them hostage and raping women. The Hamas terrorists barged into Be’eri Kibbutz on the Gaza border, unsettling the peaceful existence of this close-knit community. The lives of Kibbutz residents turned into a nightmare as Hamas terrorists stormed in compelling the people to confine themselves inside their homes. As evident from a WhatsApp group chat shared with BBC, terrified residents of the Kibbutz communicated snippets of information, their fears, desperate pleas for help and tips to help each other cope with the situation.The ensuing incident commenced with a message that said, “We have a terrorist on the stairs. Call someone.” The women in the Be’eri mothers’ WhatsApp group found themselves in the middle of a day-long rampage, chronicling their horror, disarray and survival bids as gun-yielding Hamas terrorists walked the streets, torching homes, and taking local Israelis captive. The terrorists were heard speaking in Arabic. From their safe rooms, the women and their families exchanged messages concerning the mayhem outside. They inquired as to why the army had not yet arrived, shared information about the terrorists’ locations, gave tips on how to cope with smoke-filled rooms, and continued to appeal for help.“At some point, somebody changed the name of the group to “Be’eri Mothers Emergency,” BBC reported. While in their safe rooms, the Kibbutz residents sought help from each other about how to lock the doors and also combat smoke inhalation. “Entire house is full of smoke what should I do?” someone asked.“Try to put a wet cloth on your face. Or urine,” another resident responded. Dafna Garster, who had come from Germany to stay with her family in Kibbutz told BBC that on 7th October, she heard a “sound we could not identify”. “Usually you have an alarm and a boom of the iron dome. This time, there was no alarm, and it was so loud. It’s a sound we could not identify,” Garster said. In the face of the horror, the WhatsApp group chat kept the morale and hopes of the people intact.  They relied on code language and cooperation to coordinate attempts to distinguish soldiers from Hamas militants. The arrival of the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) provided some hope, but ambiguity prevailed as people dealt with contradicting reports.With the arrival of the IDF, the horrifying ordeal came to an end. The IDF soldiers took the affected locals to safe zones. The survivors of the Hamas’s horror said that they are driving strength from their broken community, but they cannot forget those whom they have lost.According to a Telegraph report, the Hamas terrorists had taken the phones of some of the local residents and started texting on WhatsApp groups to lure out people hiding in the safe rooms.An unforeseen attack on Israel by Hamas dubbed ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Storm’ that combined gunmen violating security barriers with a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza was carried out at dawn on 7th October during the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, killing at least 1,300 people, including children and the elderly, and injuring over 2000 others.In one of the worst attacks in history, the terrorists also assaulted women and abducted hundreds. In response, Israel launched ‘Operation Iron Swords’ and used Article 40 for the first time since the Yom Kippur War in 1973, effectively declaring war.Apart from striking Hamas targets, Israel has also cut power and water supply to Gaza, as well as preventing supplies from entering the landlocked coastal strip. It is worth noting that Hamas has declared Friday, 13th October, as the day for global Jihad and has incited antisemitic sentiments around the world. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He embraced her and planted a kiss on her cheek, expressing his appreciation for her gifting him two of her artworks crafted with her feet.Iranian embassy in Spain has denied reports that ace footballer Cristiano Ronaldo could face 99 lashes the next time he visits Iran after his picture hugging an Iranian painter went viral on the internet.Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Iran’s embassy in Spain posted, “We strongly deny the issuance of any court ruling against any international athlete in Iran. It is a matter of concern that the publication of such unfounded news could overshadow crimes against humanity and war crimes against the oppressed Palestinian nation.”Desmentimos rotundamente la emisión de cualquier fallo judicial contra cualquier deportista internacional en Irán. Es motivo de preocupación que la publicación de noticias tan infundadas pueda eclipsar los crímenes de lesa humanidad y los crímenes de guerra contra la oprimida… pic.twitter.com/51xw40L7GpThey further added, “It should be noted that Cristiano Ronaldo travelled to Iran on September 18 and 19 to play in an official soccer match and was very well received by the people and the authorities. His sincere and humane meeting with Fatemeh Hamami was also praised and admired by both the people and the country’s sports authorities.”The 38-year-old Portuguese Al-Nassr star, romantically linked with Georgina Rodriguez, hugged the Iranian painter recently during his visit to Tehran. It was during his trip to Iran in September for a match against Persepolis in the Asian Champions League, a game that CR7’s side emerged victorious from with a 2-0 score.While in Iran, the soccer player presented painter Fatemeh Hamami with a signed jersey. He embraced her and planted a kiss on her cheek, expressing his appreciation for her gifting him two of her artworks crafted with her feet.As per the Iranian press, multiple Iranian lawyers have lodged accusations against Cristiano Ronaldo for this conduct. Iran has strict laws for what it considers ‘adultery’ and in accordance with Iranian law, physical contact with an unmarried woman is considered akin to adultery. Reportedly, the Iranian judiciary could have imposed a sentence of 99 lashes on Cristiano Ronaldo during his future visits to Iran. However, a judge can pardon the sentence if the actions are deemed non-punishable or if those involved express remorse.Currently, the possibility of Ronaldo returning to Iran seems limited, given that Al Nassr has no immediate plans to play there.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

88,"13 October, 2023 ","Iranian Ambassador to India Iraj Elahi claims Iran played no role in Hamas terror attack on Israel, says “Hamas an independent player”"," Iran played no role in the recent developments. It was the inevitable and foreseeable response of the Palestinians to the continuous oppression by the apartheid regime, Iraj Elahi saidResponding to an email questionnaire sent by ANI on the recent Israel-Hamas war that has engulfed the Middle East region, the Iranian Ambassador to India, Iraj Elahi, distanced his country from Hamas’ recent attack on South Israeli communities along the border with Gaza. The full transcript of the email questionnaire is as follows:ANI Question: What do you think about recent developments in Israel?Iraj Elahi-Iranian Ambassador to India: What surprises me the most is that we still rarely see an accurate representation of what really happens in Palestine. Israel commits countless atrocities against innocent Palestinians in Gaza, yet a significant portion of the media continues to overlook the Palestinians. Instead, they choose to concoct new evidence against Hamas to justify the criminal actions of the occupiers and the siege of Gaza. The Zionists act as if Palestinians are not human, suggesting that no one should care about their ceaseless suffering. This behavior illustrates the sheer brutality Palestinians endure. Regrettably, their voices and demands continue to be overshadowed in the media. No one dares to question why they should be deprived of basic human necessities like water, power, medicine, and other essential needs. The vast majority of the media deliberately ignores the truth, turning a blind eye and deaf ear to the voices and faces of Palestinians whose only “fault” is being born in Palestine.ANI: There are reports by Western media that Iran helped plot attack on Israel over several weeks? Your comment on that.Iraj Elahi-Iranian Ambassador to India: Western media tries to deny the independent power of Hamas by attributing recent developments to Iran’s support. However, in truth, the strength of Hamas stands as an undeniable fact, and it remains an independent player that can steer the course of events on its own. As the Supreme Leader has stated, Hamas executed this operation without the assistance of Iran. Nonetheless, Iran will always support the Palestinian cause and the legitimate resistance of the Palestinians, consistently condemning the ruthless violence and occupation by the Zionists.ANI: Iranian President and Saudi Crown Prince discussed the Palestinian-Israeli conflict on Wednesday, in the first telephone call between the two leaders since a China-brokered deal between Tehran and Riyadh to resume ties. If you can talk about the discussions?Iraj Elahi-Iranian Ambassador to India: Iran and Saudi Arabia, like other Muslim countries, have already announced their staunch support for Palestine cause. However, they decided to engage in dialogue to better understand each other’s viewpoints and assessments regarding recent developments, with the aim of reaching a more common understanding. During the conversation, both sides emphasized the necessity of ending hostilities against innocent people and the crucial need for unity within the Muslim world in opposition to the criminal acts of Apartheid regime.ANI: Iran is known to be one of Hamas’s biggest benefactors, contributing funds, weapons, and training. What will you say on that?Iraj Elahi-Iranian Ambassador to India: The Palestinians have independently embraced the path of truth, and they have become an inspiration for everyone resisting oppression. We admire the Palestinians; our hearts are with them and we support their legitimate resistance against the apartheid regime.ANI: What about the peace in the West Asia region and Middle East region? We have seen massive changes there. Like Abraham accords. Do you think that all is going to square 1 and this will have a fallout on the whole of the region and the world?Iraj Elahi-Iranian Ambassador to India: Zionist extremism is the primary cause of instability in the region. As long as the basic rights of Palestinians are denied, no external solution can achieve stability. In other words, any plan that doesn’t address the root causes of the conflict is destined to fail. The wounds of Palestine continue to bleed, affecting the entirety of West Asia. I believe that stability is unattainable without recognizing the rights of Palestinians. External solutions proposed by outsiders may only destabilize the region and worsen the overall situation.ANI: UK Foreign Secretary and USA Foreign Secretary are in Israel. President Biden said that his administration has warned Iran not to escalate the conflict between Tehran’s proxy Hamas and Israel. your comment?Iraj Elahi-Iranian Ambassador to India: As we said Iran played no role in the recent developments. It was the inevitable and foreseeable response of the Palestinians to the continuous oppression by the apartheid regime. Western media tries to attribute this to external factors, especially Iran, to hide the role of Zionist regime as the primary cause of the conflict. Furthermore, the US and its allies are deeply concerned about the emergence of new conflict fronts, as they recognize the vulnerabilities of the Zionist regime.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

The honorary presidents of the committee DK Imthiyaz and Sunil Kumar Bajal have claimed that Muslim vendors were excluded during the auction process undertaken to allot shops in the temple premises. Contrary to the Imthiyaz and Bajal’s claims, the temple management said that there was no restriction on Muslim vendors adding that the auction process for 94 shops in the temple courtyard was open for all, however, no non-Hindu trader participated in the auction. The temple management said that the auction process was conducted in accordance with the guidelines laid by the District Collector.It is worth noting that the Mangaladevi Temple comes under the state government’s Muzrai (Hindu religious endowment) department. Every year, a Navratri fair is organised at this temple dedicated to Goddess Shakti. This time the fair will take place between October 15 and October 24.The temple management had decided not to allow Muslim traders to participate in the fair and had begun the process of allocating stalls to businessmen on Rathabeedi Street, which is owned by the Mangaluru City Corporation. However, the temple administration has been holding its fairs here for many years.It is pertinent to note that Around 34,563 temples in the state are classified as Muzrai (Hindu religious endowment) grade A, B, or C depending on their revenue generation.In all, a total of 207 temples with yearly revenue exceeding Rs 25 lakh fall into category A, 139 temples with annual revenue between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 25 lakh fall into category B, and 34,217 temples with annual revenue less than Rs 5 lakh go into category C. This categorisation was introduced by the Congress government in 2019.Last year, a controversy had erupted over the issue of not allowing non-Hindu particularly Muslim traders to put up stalls near Hindu temples. The demand for the same was raised by Hindu rights organisations including Bajrang Dal.According to the Hindu rights organisation, Rule 12 of the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Act, 2002, is intended to prohibit non-Hindu traders. The law states that “No property, including land, building or sites situated near the premises shall be leased to non-Hindus.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

90,"13 October, 2023 ",Did a Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire while burning the Israeli flag? Know the truth behind the video which has gone viral," The video is an old one from 2021 and the incident happened during the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran in May that year.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in mass genocide, killing over 1300 Israelis and injuring hundreds more. As the Israel-Hamas war rages, a video went viral which showed a man unintentionally lighting himself on fire while burning an Israeli flag.The video has been widely shared on X since yesterday (October 12), with most of the users alleging that it was a Hamas supporter who attempted to burn the Israeli flag amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. They mocked the Hamas supporter saying that Karma paid him back. An X user @Hariindic shared the video with the caption, “Look at the current situation of Hamas – Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire! Karma works wonders.”#Hamas situation right now😂🇮🇱🇵🇸 WATCH: Hamas supporter accidentally sets himself on fire! Karma acts in wonderful ways.#Israel #IsraelPalestineWar #HamasMassacre #GazaUnderAttack #HamasTerrorism #Gaza_under_attack #HamasTerrorists #Palestine #GazaUnderAttack #Gaza pic.twitter.com/4pNnGgG6CbIn the footage, a man is seen holding a massive Israeli flag. Another man approached the man who was holding the flag and set it on fire. Within seconds, due to the direction of the wind, the clothes of the man who is holding the flag also catch fire. The man immediately drops the flag on the ground and scampers away after his clothes catch fire. Amusingly, the group of protestors who were seen standing beside him holding Palestinian flags, instead of coming to his rescue, quickly moved away from him to save themselves from the fire.Though the video was being shared extensively on X, formally Twitter, OpIndia decided to do some investigation, after which we learned that the video was an old one that resurfaced in the midst of the recent Israel-Hamas confrontation. Even in 2021, the same video was shared by numerous social media accounts. The majority of these accounts belonged to Muslim people who had posted the video to express their hostility towards Israelis.خداوندا مارا از دست پیروانت نجات بده.God, save us from your followers pic.twitter.com/T3xGT5ImJyIn fact, the Times of Israel reported about the incident in May 2021. The media report shared the same video posted by several X users then, claiming that the video was from the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran on May 7 2021.Let us inform you that in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution, Iran established Al-Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day. The Iranian government marks the day with anti-Israel rallies, demonstrations, and threats to “liberate” Jerusalem from Israeli rule.In conclusion, despite the fact that the video has recently gone viral amid the ongoing Israel and Hamas war, it is an old one from Iran and does not feature any Hamas supporters or terrorists. Though here too, the Israeli flag was burnt in a show of sympathy for Palestine and a show of anger against Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Furthermore, he forced her to abort the baby after she became pregnant and pressured her to convert to Islam. Now, the authorities have registered a First Information Report on the complaint of the girl and started an investigation. She has charged that the accused who is a resident of Ujariyaon village exploited her under the guise of marriage. The matter pertains to Gomti Nagar. The two initially met at Janeshwar Mishra Park during a stroll after which he befriended her, trapped her into a romantic bond and gradually gained her trust. His family was aware of their love affair. He regularly established a sexual relationship with her throughout this time in his house and multiple hotels on different occasions and recorded it on video. Meanwhile, she got pregnant and he began pushing her to have an abortion against her will. The girl wanted to keep the child, but he threatened and assaulted her to fulfil his demand. The perpetrator pacified her by promising marriage after she warned him to complain to the cops but even after a significant amount of time had elapsed he did not keep his word and she filed a report after which he absconded to Dubai last June. She charged that his family members were compelling her to embrace Islam and thrashed her after she protested.He also continued to push her to do the same and threatened to make her clips viral on Facebook and Instagram and defame her through social media. The police have lodged a First Information Report against a total of eight people including seven named and one unknown in connection with the abortion and religious conversion.

He assured that police teams had been formed and he would be apprehended soon.She was reportedly compulsed to undergo an Ultrasound by the offender and his sister-in-law to confirm the pregnancy after which they had the fetus terminated. She objected to their plan and was battered by them. The girl did not want to become a Muslim which was unacceptable to him and his relatives who threatened to post the private footage online. She revealed that their names are Imran Khan and Ishaan including a few others who are presently in Bahrain. They are also sending obscene videos on her mobile. She recently arrived at Afzal Siddiqui’s residence to demonstrate against their immoral actions but was beaten up severely by his family.

93,"13 October, 2023 ",Karnataka: Rs 42 crores in cash recovered from contractor Ambikapathy who alleged 40 per cent commission against previous BJP govt," As per reports, it is believed that the cash was intended for transportation to neighbouring Telangana; however, an official statement on this matter is yet to be released. The amount, in Rs 500 denominations, was stashed in 23 cardboard boxes at the residence of a former corporator from Ward 95.Late last night in Bengaluru, a sum exceeding ₹42 crore in cash was discovered concealed in 23 boxes beneath a bed. This substantial amount was unearthed during Income Tax raids on R Ambikapathy, who had alleged a 40 per cent commission against the previous government in Karnataka. As per reports, it is believed that the cash was intended for transportation to neighbouring Telangana; however, an official statement on this matter is yet to be released. The amount, in Rs 500 denominations, was stashed in 23 cardboard boxes at the residence of a former corporator from Ward 95.The contractor supposedly tried to stonewall the raid and attempted to stall the handover of keys to the flat where the money was discovered, coinciding with a suspected effort to relocate the funds, a report published in The Hindu said. It’s noteworthy to mention that Mr. Ambikapathy gained prominence during a campaign led by the Karnataka Contractors’ Association. The campaign had accused the previous BJP regime of charging a ’40 per cent commission’ for State Government contracts. Additionally, he was among the contractors apprehended in a criminal defamation case filed against them by former minister Munirathna over corruption accusations but was subsequently released.Accusing the Congress government in the state, BJP leader and former deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan claimed that the funds were amassed from contractors as a commission to finance the upcoming elections in five states.“This substantiates the allegations of an ‘ATM government’ (against the Congress government) with supporting evidence… What has been apprehended is a fraction of the funds amassed by the ‘ATM government.’ There are numerous similar instances. The seized money is a portion of the accumulated funds. Consider this as a representative example,” he remarked, encouraging other contractors to come forward and disclose the money they purportedly handed over.Dismissing the accusations as “baseless”, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah stated, “The allegations are without merit. No state (within the Congress) has requested (for money). We haven’t provided any either… Have you witnessed it? Have the (BJP members making the accusations) witnessed the transfer of funds to other states? There’s no basis for such misleading claims.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

According to reports, a sizable police presence was stationed in the nation’s capital’s streets to maintain surveillance during the Friday prayers. Security was also heightened in sensitive areas, including around the Israeli Embassy; Jewish synagogues and other Jewish establishments.In the Jama Masjid area, the Delhi police conducted a flag march to ensure public safety.Further, state authorities in Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh and Goa have been asked to ensure security for Israeli diplomats, staff and tourists.The development came after Hamas urged Muslims across the world to observe Friday Namaz as ‘day of rage’ and ‘day of jihad’ against Israel. Following the call for terrorism by Hamas, Israel warned its citizens worldwide to take extra care as pro-Palestine and anti-semitic protests have been staged in several cities around the world.In the aftermath of the calls by Hamas, an Israeli diplomat was stabbed in Beijing on Friday (13th October). According to a statement reportedly by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, the staffer is receiving medical treatment at a hospital and is stable.A purported video of the attack went viral on the internet.

95,"13 October, 2023 ","Bangladesh: Hindus attacked in Comilla during protest march against MP Bahauddin Bahar, who demonised Durga Puja as ‘festival of alcohol’"," The demonstration came under attack from Islamists belonging to the 'Chhatra League' and 'Jubo League', both affiliated with the ruling Awami League.A protest march organised by the Hindu community came under attack in the Nazrul Avenue area in ​​the Comilla metropolis of Bangladesh. The incident took place on Friday (13th October) at 11 a.m.In a video posted on YouTube by Global Television, members of the Hindu community could be seen running for cover. As per reports, a total of 5 people, including one woman, were injured during the attack. One of them also sustained severe injuries to his head. Three of the victims were identified as Aditya Das, Sunil Das and Tanmoy Das.The said demonstration was led by the Bangladesh Youth Unity Council, Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (HBCUC), Student Unity Council and Women Unity Council against the disturbing remarks made by an Awami League MP (Comilla-6 constituency) named Bahauddin Bahar about Durga Puja.According to Rana Das Gupta, the General Secretary of the Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, Bahauddin had demonised the annual Hindu Bengali festival as ‘Madjukto Puja‘ (festival of alcohol) on 4th October this year. The Awami League MP also claimed that if alcohol consumption was decreased, then, the number of Puja pandals would go down. On Thursday (12th October), he yet again associated ‘Durga Puja with alcohol’.Just last month (28th September), Munshiganj district Mayor Faisal Biplab referred to Hindu MP, Mrinal Kanti Das, as ‘malaun’ (a derogatory term for Hindus), ‘nopungshak’ (impotent) and ‘chandal’ (a derogatory term for Dalits). Miffed by the vicious targeting of the Hindu festivals, the members of the community took out a protest march and demanded action against the Awami League MP. However, the demonstration reportedly came under attack from Islamists belonging to the ‘Chhatra League’ and ‘Jubo League’.While ‘Chhatra League’ is the student wing of the Sheikh Hasina-led-Bangladesh Awami League, ‘Jubo League’ is the youth wing of the same party. Bahauddin Bahar, who made the contentious remarks about Durga Puja, is also an MP of Awami League.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

96,"13 October, 2023 ","“Fetus has no separate identity from mother”: Justice BV Nagarathna says a woman cannot be forced to undergo pregnancy, CJI says “even an unborn child has rights”"," CJI DY Chandrachud, who presided over the three-judge bench, directed ASG Aishwarya Bhati to persuade the woman to ensure her baby was born healthyOn Thursday, 12th October, a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud told a 27-year-old married woman who filed a petition to abort her 26-week fetus, that she should reconsider her decision saying that “even an unborn child had rights.”CJI DY Chandrachud, who presided over the three-judge bench, directed ASG Aishwarya Bhati to persuade the woman to ensure her baby was born healthy. The bench also stated unequivocally that it would not request that doctors stop the foetal heartbeat,’ stressing that “we cannot kill the child.”This comes after a split order was passed by a Supreme Court bench comprising Justices Hima Kohli and BV Nagarathna on Wednesday. The woman’s appeal was initially accepted by the two-judge bench. The next day, however, the Union of India filed an application to recall the ruling, citing an email from an All India Institute of Medical Sciences doctor claiming that the foetus was healthy and had a good chance of survival.Taking the email into consideration, Justice Kohli recalled the earlier ruling, stating that her “judicial conscience does not permit the petitioner to terminate the pregnancy.” However, Justice Kolhi did not approve of the conduct of the doctor who sent the email, who is a member of the medical board that initially backed medical abortion.The Supreme Court judge stated that because the petitioner is unwilling to continue the pregnancy, whether the foetus is viable or not is “irrelevant”.“The pregnant lady is not interested in continuing with the pregnancy. In such a case, whether the child to be born is viable or if the infant will be healthy is irrelevant. What is to be focused upon is, whether or not the pregnant lady intends to give birth to a child,” Justice Nagarathna said.Justice Nagarathna went on to assert that a “fetus has no individual personality from the mother” since it is dependent on the mother for “its very existence.”“It would be incongruous to conclude that the foetus has a separate identity from the mother and in spite of the physical or mental health of a mother being under threat, she will have to continue her pregnancy until the foetus is born which would endanger her delicate health. Such a position is contrary to Article 21 and 15(3) of the Constitution of India which recognize the right to life and liberty and particularly those of a woman,” Justice Nagarathna said.The three-judge bench, led by the CJI, expressed reluctance to allow the petitioner to end the pregnancy due to the viability of the foetus. During the hearing, CJI Chandrachud stated that the rights of the unborn child are just as essential as the decisional autonomy of the woman. The hearing was adjourned until today to provide the petitioner time to consider.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

If anyone attempts to spread malicious content, prompt and severe action should be taken against them,"" the government spokesperson, privy to the meeting, said.On Thursday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath warned those spreading hate over the Israel-Palestine conflict, asserting that supporters of Hamas will not be spared. He firmly instructed state officials to deal with individuals attempting to incite hatred and provoke unrest concerning the Palestine matter amidst the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in West Asia.In a law and order review meeting held at his Lucknow residence, the UP CM made it clear that any actions conflicting with the stance of the Government of India regarding this matter would not be tolerated, as reported by an official.“The chief minister mandated that regardless of the platform—be it social media or any place of worship—no divisive statements should be made by anyone. If anyone attempts to spread malicious content, prompt and severe action should be taken against them,” the government spokesperson, privy to the meeting, said.Adityanath additionally instructed the police and administrative heads of each district to engage with local religious leaders and convey this message to them.The instructions from the Chief Minister follow closely after four students from Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) in the state were charged for reportedly organizing a demonstration in support of Palestine on the campus. Various political figures lodged complaints with the police, expressing their opposition to the pro-Palestine march on the university grounds. In response, AMU stated that they had initiated an internal investigation into the incident.Since the previous Saturday, Hamas-led targeted assaults on Israeli civilians have resulted in the loss of 1,300 lives on the Israeli side, including deaths of babies, toddlers, and infants, some of whom have been brutally beheaded and burnt alive.

They have shown Israel ke wajood ki koi haisiyat nahi hai’: Congress Working President, Ladakh pic.twitter.com/9oBM9Dr4YgThe Islamist terrorist organisation Hamas has been inflicting unspeakable violent crimes on Israeli civilians, including brutal murders, the beheading of children, rape, kidnap and taking hostage, yet the Congress leader, in a video shared by Times Now, is heard hailing the Hamas terrorists and justifying the atrocities they have been committing.He can be heard applauding the ‘Hamas Mujahideen’ from Gaza for carrying out attacks against Israel, which he refers to as the slave of the ‘biggest devils’- the United States of America. The Congress leader further lauded the Palestinians for conquering back their land which he claimed they lost to the Israelis.The Congress leader proudly admitted that Hamas terrorists have killed and kidnapped several Israeli soldiers while justifying the atrocities that Hamas perpetrated against Israel and its defence forces as well as its innocent citizens. He exulted that the Palestinian mujahideen had shown to the world that they would never submit to the Israelis despite all the constraints, sanctions, and repression.Further gushing over the war Hamas has declared against Israel, he said that the Palestinians have proven that “Israel ke wajood ki koi haisiyat nahi hai. Woh makde ke jaale see bhi kamjor hai, yeh unhone 7 October ko dikhla diya” (the existence of Israel is worthless. It is weaker than a spider’s web. This the Palestinians proved on October 7), he said.Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of the Ladakh Congress, continued to blatantly lie projecting Israelis as the aggressors and the Palestinians as the victims despite the fact that Israel only launched counterattacks on Gaza as retaliation to the devastation and mass destruction Hamas terrorists caused in Israel. He claimed that the Israeli soldiers killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians and massacred their babies. Though it is true that many civilians from both sides have fallen prey to the war that was started by the Hamas terrorists on October 7, there are umpteen videos and images available on the internet that depict the extent of brutality and savagery members of the Islamists terror organisation Hamas have inflicted on Israeli civilians and defence personnel in these last 5 days. The numerous distressing visuals that have surfaced on social media, in fact, serve as evidence that Hamas terrorists have murdered over 1300 innocent Israeli people, including women, the elderly, and newborns, by shooting, stabbing, beheading, and even burning them alive. In fact, on Thursday, October 12, the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel took the extraordinary step of releasing gruesome photos of murdered babies to reporters and the public, seeking to underscore the atrocities carried out by Hamas in its savage rampage through southern Israel on Saturday. OpIndia also listed 15 such videos showing how Hamas targeted innocent civilians and inflicted brutalities in Israel.The views of Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of Ladakh Congress, were in tandem with his party supremos who had also expressed sympathy for Palestinians. A resolution passed on October 9, by the Congress Working Committee (CWC) voiced concern over the situation and urged for a ceasefire. The resolution however backed the Palestinian people’s rights.The Congress party’s official statement emphasised the process of “dialogue and negotiations” to resolve the problem between Israel and Palestine.India's Congress party comes in support of Palestine after a key meeting https://t.co/5XqyfamvVH“The Indian National Congress has always believed that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of self-respect, equality, and dignity must be fulfilled only through a process of dialogue and negotiations while ensuring the legitimate national security interests of the Israeli people.

99,"13 October, 2023 ",Politics of prisoners heats up in Tamil Nadu: Muslim groups demand the release of 36 Muslim prisoners after AIADMK sought the release of Coimbatore blast convicts," CM Stalin questioned AIADMK for their sudden demand for the release of Muslim prisoners, while BJP has opposed the demandPolitics have heated up in Tamil Nadu over the demand to release Muslim prisoners from jail, including those convicted in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast. Opposition parties including AIADMK, which recently exited NDA, are demanding the release of Muslim prisoners who have served a long time in jail. BJP is opposing the demand, while DMK is questioning AIADMK’s sudden love for Muslim prisoners. DMK is also trying to take a secular stand here, saying there the govt will not see prisoners based on their religion.The matter was raised in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday when a motion was raised seeking the release of the 36 Muslim prisoners. Almost all opposition parties in the assembly supported the motion, except BJP. Raising the matter in assembly, AIADMK leader Edappadi K Palaniswami urged the state to release them. He cited their health conditions and added that they have been in prison for more than 20 years. Palaniswami said that several political parties had been demanding the release of these prisoners and the state government should heed their plea.Several other MLAs from different parties made similar demands. Responding to the same, CM MK Stalin said that the government has already taken steps to release prisoners. He said that the state government had set up a six-member committee, led by retired Madras High Court judge, Justice N Authinathan, in December 2021 to look into the matter.The panel had recommended the release of 224 prisoners, following which the state decided to first release 49 prisoners, of which 20 were Muslim. The chief minister said the documents on the release were pending with Governor RN Ravi for his assent.Stalin also questioned AIADMK for their sudden demand for the release of Muslim prisoners. “While in power you didn’t take any steps to release Muslim prisoners. You blindly supported CAA and NRC. We and the minority community clearly know why AIADMK is showing such affection towards Muslim prisoners now”, said the CM.On the other hand, BJP has objected to the demand. State BJP chief K Annamalai has cautioned the state government against the premature release of the terrorists serving life imprisonment in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast case. Annamalai said he believed that terrorism shouldn’t be confined to a religion or community.In February 1998, a bomb blast by Radical Islamic Fundamentalists in a serene city like Coimbatore led to the loss of 58 lives and injured over 200.The SC last week stuck down the bail application filed by a few convicts in this case & reiterated it as an atrocious act. Despite…Annamalai wrote on X that he hoped good sense would prevail and Chief Minister M K Stalin would stop “his misadventure of releasing the radical Islamic fundamentalists” from prison.Apart from political parties, other organisations also have joined the demand. Several Muslim organisations held a protest in Chennai on Wednesday, 11 October, demanding the release of 36 Muslim prisoners serving jail terms on terror charges. The protest was led by the Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi (MJK), and it was organised outside the Triplicane mosque in Chennai, India Today reported.Muslim Organisations held protests in Chennai for the release of 36 Muslim prisoners serving life imprisonment for more than 20 years.#ReporterDiary (@PramodMadhav6) pic.twitter.com/Zi7TM9UpltThe Protestors also burnt the image of CM MK Stalin and raised slogans against the government. Later all the protesters were detained by the Chennai police.General Secretary of Manidhaneya Jananayaka Katchi, Taminun Ansari said “We held a protest today in Chennai demanding prisoners who served more than 20 years in Tamil Nadu prison should be released. We also thank the political parties who support our demand. We are shocked that the CM said in the Assembly that they have sent this to the Governor where already 22 bills are pending. We are going to siege the assembly now.”“Rape convicts in Bilkis Bano case were prematurely released by the Gujarat government. They have no moral rights to speak about this”, Thameemul Ansari said justifying the demand.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Even as China has said it was “saddened” by the Israeli casualties, it has failed to condemn Hamas.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

103,"13 October, 2023 ",Promoters of the Mahadev Betting app had links with Dawood Ibrahim’s D-company: Enforcement Directorate ," The money employed in the scam was transferred to Middle Eastern nations, notably Dubai, through at least 500 hawala operators and almost 70 shell firms.The D-company, the criminal organisation created and run by one of India’s most wanted terrorists and accused of the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts Dawood Ibrahim made agreements with the promoters of the Mahadev online betting application, Enforcement Directorate which is presently investigating the case, revealed recently. As per a report in Times Now, the promoters were in contact with Dawood Ibrahim’s brother Mustaqeem Ali Kaskar about developing an identical betting site for Pakistan where Dawood Ibrahim is reportedly hiding in Karachi. The agency is expected to charge Sourabh Chandrakar, one of the promoters of the app for crimes relating to terrorism based on these grounds. Following the success of the Mahadev betting app, Mustaqeem Ali Kaskar reportedly reached out to Sourabh Chandrakar in order to ask him to set up a similar betting platform for Pakistan that would deal in the country’s rupees. He also received about thirty bodyguards from the former during his visit to Dubai. The money employed in the scam was transferred to Middle Eastern nations, notably Dubai, through at least 500 hawala operators and almost 70 shell firms.Investigations by the ED have uncovered that the key figures behind the Mahadev betting app case, Sourabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal, joined forces with Dawood Ibrahim's brother to create a similar betting platform for Pakistan.@AruneelS | @RakeshKTrivedi pic.twitter.com/bcuKqD11gCMany senior politicians, government officials, entertainers, and businesspersons have reportedly been involved in the Mahadev betting app scam, the report stated. According to the agency sources, the app’s promoters have been using a vast network of Hawala operators and more than 70 shell companies to launder money to Middle Eastern nations like Dubai while operating out of Pakistan and expanding their company into Thailand.Sahara, Sharada, Rose Valley, and other Ponzi schemes are accused of robbing depositors of their hard-earned money many of whom committed suicide, but there was no national security component. It was an antiquated technique for defrauding individuals by promising them greater returns while trapping them in a debt trap. However, as the investigation into the Mahadev betting app moves forward, a ton of vital information, proof and particulars have come to light that might blow the cover off a potential financial plot against India, the report stated.At least 138 online gambling apps with ties to China and other questionable foreign jurisdictions were prohibited by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in an order issued in February. Lotus 365 and other betting apps are registered in foreign jurisdictions and are not recognized by the Indian government.However, there are still social media and online adverts for these programs. The websites for the individual apps display a WhatsApp number and a registration link for players and gamblers on the landing page. A senior Enforcement Directorate official probing the matter revealed, “These apps work like casinos but the only difference is the legal validation. Casinos are regulated, while these apps are completely illegal and they do not have any book of accounts.”Another officer disclosed, “The WhatsApp link leads the person interested in playing or betting to the Paytm or G Pay options. Once they pay, the money goes to the accounts of the panel members who control the app or website interface. After deducting a percentage as commission, the panel members send the money to the Hawala accounts or shell companies. Then, through a process, the money is laundered to offshore accounts. One Hawala operator handles around 200-300 clients.”The agency additionally uncovered some evidence while looking into the specifics that related the Reddy Anna app with some key politicians and exposed crucial connections with Hyderabad. He mentioned, “We have found some sensitive details, which cannot be divulged at this point. We will file a detailed chargesheet this month.” The Mahadev betting application was created by four people including key accused Saurabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal from Madhya Pradesh and it gradually replaced at least 10 similar illicit betting apps that were being used all over the country. Lotus 365 and ReddyAnna are a couple of the applications that were once part of the Mahadev betting fold.As many as 34 Bollywood celebrities including actors, singers, dancers etc. have come under the Enforcement Directorate ED scanner in connection with the scam. Raftaar, Sonu Sood, Hardy Sandhu, Sonakshi Sinha, Malaika Arora and Amit Trivedi some of the names. The agency also summoned actor Ranbir Kapoor in relation to the case after several Bollywood personalities attended and performed at the wedding ceremony of Saurabh Chandrakar.
